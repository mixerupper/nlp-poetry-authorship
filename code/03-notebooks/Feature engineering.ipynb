A shrine is rais\\'d to thee,\\nWhich, nor the tempest-breath of time,\\nNor the interminable flood\\nOver earth\\'s slight pageant rolling,\\nAvaileth to destroy—\\nThe sensitive extension of the world.\\nThat wondrous and eternal fane,\\nWhere pain and pleasure, good and evil join,\\nTo do the will of strong necessity,\\nAnd life, in multitudinous shapes,\\nStill pressing forward where no term can be,\\nLike hungry and unresting flame\\nCurls round the eternal columns of its strength.\"'"
