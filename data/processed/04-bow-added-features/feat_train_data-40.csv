year look backward resum answer children
com tell u old man young men maiden love me
arous'd angri i'd thought beat alarum urg relentless war
but soon finger fail'd face droop'd resign'd myself
to sit wound sooth silent watch dead
year henc scene furious passion chances
of unsurpass'd hero one side brave equal brave
now wit paint mightiest armi earth
of armi rapid wondrous saw tell us
what stay latest deepest curious panics
of hardfought engag sieg tremend deepest remains




o maiden young men love love me
what ask day strangest sudden talk recalls
soldi alert arriv long march cover'd sweat dust
in nick time come plung fight loud shout rush success charge
ent captur'd works—yet lo like swift run river fade
pass gone fade—i dwell soldier peril soldier joys
both rememb well—mani hardship joy yet content

22,"day long nois battl rolld
among mountain winter sea
until king arthur tabl man man
had fallen lyonness lord
k arthur wound deep
th bold sir bediver uplift him
sir bediver last knights
and bore chapel nigh field
a broken chancel broken cross
that stood dark strait barren land
on one side lay ocean one
lay great water moon full

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
th sequel today unsold all
th goodliest fellowship famous knights
whereof world hold record sleep
they sleep—th men love think we
shal never futur time
delight soul talk knight deeds
walk garden halls
of camelot day were
i perish peopl made—
tho merlin sware come again
to rule more—but let be
i deepli smitten thro helm
that without help cannot last till morn
thou therefor take brand excalibur
which pride thou rememberest how
in old day one summer noon arm
ros bosom lake
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
hold sword—and rowd across
and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
in aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere
watch thou seëst light bring word

to repli bold sir bedivere
it meet sir king leav thee thus
aidless alon smitten thro helm
a littl thing may harm wound man
yet thi hest perform full
watch see light bring thee word

so say ruind shrine stept
and moon athwart place tombs
wher lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shril chill flake foam step down
bi zigzag path jut point rock
cam shine level lake

ther drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon
brighten skirt long cloud ran forth
and sparkl keen frost hilt
for haft twinkl diamond sparks
myriad topazlight jacinth work
of subtlest jewelleri gaze long
that eye dazzl stood
thi way divid swift mind
in act throw last seemd
bett leav excalibur conceald
ther manyknot waterflags
that whistl stiff dri marge
so strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
hast thou performd mission gave
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard rippl wash reeds
and wild water lap crag

to repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betrayd thi natur thi name
not render true answer beseemd
thi fealti like nobl knight
for surer sign followd either hand
or voic els motion mere
thi shame thing men lie
yet charg thee quick go again
a thou art lief dear thing
i bade thee watch light bring word

then went sir bediver second time
across ridg pace besid mere
count dewi pebbl fix thought
but saw wonder hilt
how curious strang chase smote
hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sur precious thing one worthi note
should thus lost forev earth
which might pleas eye mani men
what good follow done
what harm undon deep harm disobey
se obedi bond rule
wer well obey king demand
an act unprofit himself
th king sick know does
what record relic lord
should aftertim empti breath
and rumour doubt kept
stor treasurehous mighti kings
som one might show joust arms
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nin year wrought sit deeps
upon hidden base hills
so might old man speak aftertime
to peopl win reverence
but much honour much fame lost

so spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

then spoke king arthur breath heavily
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur much wrath
ah miser unkind untrue
unknight traitorheart woe me
author forget die king
laid widowd power eye
that bowd see thee thou art
for thou latestleft knights
in meet offic all
thou wouldst betray precious hilt
eith lust gold like girl
valu giddi pleasur eyes
yet man may fail duti twice
and third time may prosper get thee hence
but thou spare fling excalibur
i aris slay thee hands

then quick rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg light plunged
among bulrushb clutchd sword
and strong wheeld threw great brand
mad lightn splendour moon
and flash round round whirld arch
shot like streamer northern morn
seen move isl winter shock
bi night nois northern sea
so flashd fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
and caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere
and light went king

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done
speak thou hast heard seen

and answer made bold sir bedivere
sir king close mine eyelid lest gems
should blind purpos never saw
nor shall see elsewher till die
not tho live three life mortal men
so great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel him
but lookd behold arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
that caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere

and answer made king arthur breath hard
mi end draw nigh time gone
mak broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
mi wound hath taken cold shall die

so say pavement half rose
slowli pain reclin arm
and look wist wide blue eyes
a pictur sir bedivere
remors regard thro tears
and would spoken found words
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hands
and rise bore thro place tombs

but walkd king arthur pant hard
lik one feel nightmar bed
when hous mute sighd king
mutt murmur ear quick quick
i fear late shall die
but swift strode ridg ridge
cloth breath look walkd
larg human frozen hills
h heard deep behind cry
befor thought drove like goad
dri clashd har ici caves
and barren chasm left right
th bare black cliff clangd round based
hi foot jut slipperi crag rang
sharpsmitten dint arm heels—
and sudden lo level lake
and long glori winter moon

then saw hove duski barge
dark funer scarf stem stern
beneath descend ware
that deck dens state forms
blackstol blackhood like dream—bi these
thre queen crown gold—and rose
a cri shiverd tingl stars
and one voic agony
of lament like wind shrills
al night wast land one comes
or hath come sinc make world

then murmurd arthur place barge
and barg came three queens
put forth hand took king wept
but rose tallest all
and fairest laid head upon lap
and loos shatterd casqu chafe hands
and calld name complain loud
and drop bitter tear brow
strip dark blood face white
and colourless like witherd moon
smot fresh beam spring east
and greav cuiss dashd drops
of onset light lustrous curls—
that made forehead like rise sun
high daïsthrone—wer parchd dust
or clot point hang loose
mixd knight growth fring lips
so like shatterd column lay king
not like arthur lanc rest
from spur plume star tournament
shot thro list camelot charged
befor eye ladi kings

then loud cri bold sir bedivere
ah lord arthur whither shall go
wher shall hide forehead eyes
for see true old time dead
when everi morn brought nobl chance
and everi chanc brought nobl knight
such time sinc light led
th holi elder gift myrrh
but whole round tabl dissolved
which imag mighti world
and last go forth companionless
and day darken round years
among new men strang face minds

and slowli answerd arthur barge
th old order changeth yield place new
and god fulfil mani ways
lest one good custom corrupt world
comfort thyself comfort me
i live life done
may within make pure thou
if thou shouldst never see face again
pray soul thing wrought prayer
than world dream wherefor let thi voice
ris like fountain night day
for men better sheep goats
that nourish blind life within brain
if know god lift hand prayer
both call friend
for whole round earth everi way
bound gold chain foot god
but farewel go long way
with thou seëst—if inde go—
for mind cloud doubt
to islandvalley avilion
wher fall hail rain snow
nor ever wind blow loud lies
deepmeadowd happi fair orchardlawns
and boweri hollow crownd summer sea
wher heal grievous wound

so said barg oar sail
mov brink like fullbreast swan
that flute wild carol ere death
ruffl pure cold plume take flood
with swarthi web long stood sir bedivere

111,"hail thee blith spirit
bird thou never wert
that heaven near it
pourest thi full heart
in profus strain unpremedit art

high still higher
from earth thou springest
lik cloud fire
th blue deep thou wingest
and sing still dost soar soar ever singest

in golden lightning
of sunken sun
oer cloud brightning
thou dost float run
lik unbodi joy whose race begun

th pale purpl even
melt around thi flight
lik star heaven
in broad daylight
thou art unseen yet hear thi shrill delight

keen arrows
of silver sphere
whos intens lamp narrows
in white dawn clear
until hard see feel there

al earth air
with thi voic loud
a night bare
from one lone cloud
th moon rain beam heaven overflowd

what thou art know not
what like thee
from rainbow cloud flow not
drop bright see
a thi presenc shower rain melody

lik poet hidden
in light thought
sing hymn unbidden
til world wrought
to sympathi hope fear heed not

lik highborn maiden
in palacetower
sooth loveladen
soul secret hour
with music sweet love overflow bower

lik glowworm golden
in dell dew
scatt unbeholden
it aereal hue
among flower grass screen view

lik rose embowerd
in green leaves
bi warm wind deflowerd
til scent gives
mak faint much sweet heavywing thieves

sound vernal showers
on twinkl grass
rainawakend flowers
al ever was
joy clear fresh thi music doth surpass

teach u sprite bird
what sweet thought thine
i never heard
prais love wine
that pant forth flood raptur divine

chorus hymeneal
or triumphal chant
matchd thine would all
but empti vaunt
a thing wherein feel hidden want

what object fountains
of thi happi strain
what field wave mountains
what shape sky plain
what love thine kind ignor pain

with thi clear keen joyance
languor cannot be
shadow annoyance
nev came near thee
thou lovest neer knew love sad satiety

wak asleep
thou death must deem
th true deep
than mortal dream
or could thi note flow crystal stream

w look after
and pine not
our sincerest laughter
with pain fraught
our sweetest song tell saddest thought

yet could scorn
hat pride fear
if thing born
not shed tear
i know thi joy ever come near

bett measures
of delight sound
bett treasures
that book found
thi skill poet thou scorner ground

teach half gladness
that thi brain must know

in first sweet sleep night
when wind breath low
and star shine bright
i aris dream thee
and spirit feet
hath led me—who know how
to thi chamber window sweet

th wander air faint
on dark silent stream—

lik sweet thought dream
th nightingal complaint
it dy upon heart—

oh lift grass
i die faint fail
let thi love kiss rain

for meet morrow
th delight happi laughter
th delight low replies

ti morn pure sweet
and dewi splendour falls
on littl flower clings
to turret walls
ti morn pure sweet
and light shadow fleet
sh walk meadow
and woodland echo rings
in moment shall meet
sh sing meadow
and rivulet feet
rippl light shadow
to ballad sings

so hear sing old
mi bird shine head
mi dove tender eye
but ring sudden passion cry
ther one die dead
and sullen thunder rolld
for tumult shake city
and wake dream fled
in shudder dawn behold
without knowledg without pity
bi curtain bed
that abid phantom cold

mix memori doubt
pass thou deathlik type pain
pass ceas move about
ti blot upon brain
that show without

then rise eavedrop fall
and yellow vapour choke
th great citi sound wide
th day come dull red ball
wrapt drift lurid smoke
on misti rivertide

thro hubbub market
i steal wast frame
it cross cross there
thro crowd confus loud
th shadow still same
and heavi eyelids
mi anguish hang like shame

ala met me
that heard soft call
cam glimmer thro laurels
at quiet evenfall
in garden turrets
of old manori hall

would happi spirit descend
from realm light song
in chamber street
a look among blest
should fear greet friend
or say forgiv wrong
or ask take sweet
to region thi rest

but broad light glare beats
and shadow flit fleets
and let be
and loath squar streets
and face one meets
heart love me
alway long creep
into still cavern deep
ther weep weep weep

that first greek touch trojan strand

so summer task end mary
and return thee mine heart home
a queen victor knight fa
ë
ry
earn bright spoil inchant dome
nor thou disdain ere fame become
a star among star mortal night
if inde may cleav natal gloom
it doubt promis thus would unite
with thi belov name thou child love light



th toil stole thee mani hour
i ended—and fruit thi feet
no longer wood frame bower
with interlac branch mix meet
or sound like mani voic sweet
waterfal leap among wild island green
which frame lone boat lone retreat
of mossgrown tree weed shall seen
but besid thee still heart ever been



thought great deed mine dear friend first
th cloud wrap world youth pass
i rememb well hour burst
mi spirit sleep fresh maydawn was
when walk forth upon glitter grass
and wept knew rose
from near schoolroom voic alas
wer one echo world woes—
th harsh grate strife tyrant foes



and clasp hand look around—
—but none near mock stream eyes
which pour warm drop sunni ground—
so without shame spake—i wise
and free mild lies
such power grow weari behold
th selfish strong still tyrannise
without reproach check controuled
mi tear heart grew calm meek bold



and hour earnest thought
heap knowledg forbidden mine lore
yet noth tyrant knew taught
i care learn secret store
wrought link armour soul before
it might walk forth war among mankind
thus power hope strengthen more
within till came upon mind
a sens loneli thirst pined



ala love blight snare
to seek sympathi one—
such sought vain black despair
th shadow starless night thrown
ov world move alone—
yet never found one fals me
hard heart cold like weight ici stone
which crush wither mine could be
aught lifeless clog reviv thee



thou friend whose presenc wintri heart
fel like bright spring upon herbless plain
how beauti calm free thou wert
in thi young wisdom mortal chain
of custom thou didst burst rend twain
and walk free light cloud among
which mani envious slave breath vain
from dim dungeon spirit sprung
to meet thee woe begirt long



no alon world wilderness
although trod path high intent
i journey companionless
wher solitud like despair went—
ther wisdom stern content
when poverti blight good
when infami dare mock innocent
and cherish friend turn multitude
to trampl unshaken stood



now descend seren hour
and inconst fortun friend return
though suffer leaf knowledg power
which says—let scorn repaid scorn
and thi side two gentl babe born
to fill home smile thus we
most fortun beneath life beam morn
and delight thou me
th parent song consecr thee



i inexperienc fingers
but strike prelud loftier strain
or must lyre spirit lingers
soon paus silenc neer sound again
though might shake anarch custom reign
and charm mind men truth sway
holi amphion would fain
repli hope—but worn away
and death love yet contend prey



and art thou know dare speak
tim may interpret silent years
yet pale thi thought cheek
and light thine ampl forehead wears
and thi sweetest smile thi tears
and thi gentl speech prophecy
i whisper subdu fondest fears
and thine eye even thi soul see
a lamp vestal fire burn internally



they say thou wert love thi birth
of glorious parent thou aspir child
i wonder not—for one left earth
whos life like set planet mild
which cloth thee radianc undefiled
of depart glori still fame
shin thee tempest dark wild
which shake latter day thou canst claim
th shelter thi sire immort name



on voic came forth mani mighti spirit
which echo three thousand years
and tumultu world stood mute hear it
a lone man desart hears
th music home—unwont fears
fel pale oppressor race
and faith custom lowthought cares
lik thunderstricken dragon space
left torn human heart food dwellingplace



truth deathless voic paus among mankind
if must respons cry—
if men must rise stamp furi blind
on pure name love them—thou i
sweet friend look tranquillity
lik lamp world tempestu night—

259,"wind beat mountain blows
mor soft round open wold
and gentl come world those
that cast gentl mould

and knowledg bolder made
or els dare flow
in word toward invade
even vers holi woe

ti strang lean most
thos whose lap limb nursed
fal shadow soonest lost
thos love first taken first

god give u love someth love
h lend u love grown
to ripe throve
fal love left alone

thi curs time alas
in grief unlearnd
onc thro mine door death pass
on went never hath returnd

h smile—not speak me
onc two year chair seen
empti u he
without whose life been

your loss rarer star
ros thro littl arc
of heaven wanderd far
shot sudden dark

i knew brother mute dust
i honour live worth
a man pure bold just
wa never born earth

i lookd upon nigh
sinc dear soul hath falln asleep
great natur wise i
i tell weep

and tho mine eye fill dew
drawn spirit thro brain
i even preach you
weep weep dull inward pain

let grief mistress still
sh loveth anguish deep
mor much pleasur let will
b done—to weep weep

i say god ordinance
of death blown everi wind
for common chance
that take away nobl mind

hi memori long live alone
in heart mourn light
that brood fallen sun
and dwell heaven half night

vain solac memori stand near
cast eye throat
her voic seemd distant tear
dropt letter wrote

i wrote know truth
how sooth anyway
who miss brother youth
yet someth wish say

for friend me
both friend true breast
bleedeth yet may be
that silenc suiteth best

word weaker grief would make
grief twere better cease
although could almost take
th place sleep peace

sleep sweet tender heart peace
sleep holi spirit bless soul
whil star burn moon increase
and great age onward roll

sleep till end true soul sweet

whereto move strove youth
and brake petti king fought rome
or thrust heathen roman wall
and shook thro north ill doom mine

and long mountain end coast

a deathwhit mist slept sand sea
whereof chill breath drew
down blood till heart cold
with formless fear evn arthur fell

for friend foe shadow mist
and friend slew friend know slew
and vision golden youth
and beheld face old ghosts

k arthur wound deep
th bold sir bediver uplift him
and bore chapel nigh field
a broken chancel broken cross
that stood dark strait barren land
on one side lay ocean one
lay great water moon full

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
th sequel today unsold all

whereof world hold record sleep
they sleep—th men love think we

tho merlin sware come again

that without help cannot last till morn
thou therefor take brand excalibur
which pride thou rememberest how

and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
in aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere

to repli bold sir bedivere
it meet sir king leav thee thus
aidless alon smitten thro helm—
a littl thing may harm wound man

watch see light bring thee word

so say ruind shrine stept
and moon athwart place tombs
wher lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shril chill flake foam step down
bi zigzag path jut point rock
cam shine level lake

ther drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon
brighten skirt long cloud ran forth
and sparkl keen frost hilt
for haft twinkl diamond sparks

of subtlest jewelleri gaze long
that eye dazzl stood

so strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bedivere

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betrayd thi natur thi name

for surer sign followd either hand

then went sir bediver second time

hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sur precious thing one worthi note

what record relic lord
should aftertim empti breath
and rumour doubt kept
stor treasurehous mighti kings
som one might show joust arms
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nin year wrought sit deeps
upon hidden base hills
so might old man speak aftertime
to peopl win reverence
but much honour much fame lost

so spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

then spoke king arthur breath heavily
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur much wrath
ah miser unkind untrue

yet man may fail duti twice
and third time may prosper get thee hence
but thou spare fling excalibur
i aris slay thee hands

then quick rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg light plunged
among bulrush bed clutchd sword
and strong wheeld threw great brand
mad lightn splendour moon
and flash round round whirld arch
shot like streamer northern morn
seen move isl winter shock
bi night nois northern sea
so flashd fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
and caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere
and light went king

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done

and answer made bold sir bedivere
sir king close mine eyelid lest gems

not tho live three life mortal men
so great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel him
but lookd behold arm

that caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere

and answer made king arthur breath hard
mi end draw nigh ti time gone
mak broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
mi wound hath taken cold shall die

so say pavement half rose
slowli pain reclin arm
and look wist wide blue eyes
a pictur sir bedivere
remors regard thro tears
and would spoken found words
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hands
and rise bore thro place tombs

but walkd king arthur pant hard
lik one feel nightmar bed
when hous mute sighd king
mutt murmur ear quick quick
i fear late shall die
but swift strode ridg ridge
cloth breath look walkd
larg human frozen hills
h heard deep behind cry
befor thought drove like goad
dri clashd har ici caves
and barren chasm left right
th bare black cliff clangd round based
hi foot jut slipperi crag rang
sharpsmitten dint arm heels—
and sudden lo level lake
and long glori winter moon

then saw hove duski barge
dark funer scarf stem stern
beneath descend ware
that deck dens state forms
blackstol blackhood like dream—bi these
thre queen crown gold rose
a cri shiverd tingl stars
and one voic agony
of lament like wind shrills
al night wast land one comes
or hath come sinc make world

then murmurd arthur place barge
so barg came three queens
put forth hand took king wept
but rose tallest all
and fairest laid head upon lap
and loos shatterd casqu chafe hands
and calld name complain loud
and drop bitter tear brow

smot fresh beam spring east
and greav cuiss dashd drops
of onset light lustrous curls—
that made forehead like rise sun
high daïsthrone—wer parchd dust
or clot point hang loose
mixd knight growth fring lips
so like shatterd column lay king
not like arthur lanc rest
from spur plume star tournament
shot thro list camelot charged
befor eye ladi kings

then loud cri bold sir bedivere
ah lord arthur whither shall go
wher shall hide forehead eyes
for see true old time dead
when everi morn brought nobl chance
and everi chanc brought nobl knight
such time sinc light led
th holi elder gift myrrh
but whole round tabl dissolved
which imag mighti world
and last go forth companionless
and day darken round years
among new men strang face minds

and slowli answerd arthur barge
th old order changeth yield place new
and god fulfil mani ways
lest one good custom corrupt world
comfort thyself comfort me
i live life done
may within make pure thou
if thou shouldst never see face again
pray soul thing wrought prayer
than world dream wherefor let thi voice
ris like fountain night day
for men better sheep goats
that nourish blind life within brain
if know god lift hand prayer
both call friend
for whole round earth everi way
bound gold chain foot god
but farewel go long way
with thou seëst—if inde go
for mind cloud doubt—
to islandvalley avilion
wher fall hail rain snow
nor ever wind blow loud lies
deepmeadowd happi fair orchard lawns
and boweri hollow crownd summer sea
wher heal grievous wound

so said barg oar sail
mov brink like fullbreast swan
that flute wild carol ere death
ruffl pure cold plume take flood
with swarthi web long stood sir bedivere
revolv mani memori till hull
lookd one black dot verg dawn
and mere wail die away

but moan past evermore
th still dead world winter dawn
amaz groand king gone
and therewith came weird rhyme
from great deep great deep goes

whereat slowli turnd slowli clomb
th last hard footstep iron crag
thenc markd black hull move yet cried
h pass king among dead
and heal grievous wound
h come but—if come more—
o yon dark queen yon black boat
who shriekd waild three whereat gazed
on high day cloth live light
they stood throne silenc friends
of arthur help need

then dawn seemd came faint
a beyond limit world
lik last echo born great cry
sound fair citi one voice
around king return wars

thereat move clomb
evn highest could climb saw
strain eye beneath arch hand
or thought saw speck bare king

for one fair hous emont side
thi day distinguish without peer
to see master cheer—
him ladymoth dear

oh time forlorn
when fatherless born—
giv wing may fly
or see infant die

to cave brooks
to cloud heaven looks
sh speechless eyes
pray ghost agonies
bliss mari mother mild
maid mother undefiled
sav mother child

now bound joy
on carrock side shepherdboy
no thought hath thought pass
light wind along grass
can hither came
in secret like smother flame
o thank tear shed
for shelter poor man bread
god love child god hath willed
that dear word fulfilled
th ladi word forc away

for lowli shepherd life best

ala evil men strong
no life good pleasur long
th boy must part mosedal groves
and leav blencathara rug coves
and quit flower summer brings
to glenderamakin lofti springs

—giv sir lancelot threlkeld praise

358,"aw shadow unseen power
float though unseen among u visiting
thi various world inconst wing
a summer wind creep flower flower
lik moonbeam behind pini mountain shower
it visit inconst glance
each human heart countenance
lik hue harmoni evening
lik cloud starlight wide spread
lik memori music fled
lik aught grace may be
dear yet dearer mystery

spirit beauti dost consecrate
with thine hue thou dost shine upon
of human thought form art thou gone
whi dost thou pas away leav state
thi dim vast vale tear vacant desolate
ask sunlight ever
weav rainbow oer yon mountainriver
whi aught fail fade shown
whi fear dream death birth
cast daylight earth
such gloom man scope
for love hate despond hope

no voic sublim world hath ever
to sage poet respons given
therefor name demon ghost heaven
remain record vain endeavour
frail spell whose utterd charm might avail sever
from hear see
doubt chanc mutability
thi light alon like mist oer mountain driven
or music nightwind sent
through string still instrument
or moonlight midnight stream
giv grace truth life unquiet dream

lov hope selfesteem like cloud depart
and come uncertain moment lent
man immort omnipotent
didst thou unknown aw thou art
keep thi glorious train firm state within heart
thou messeng sympathies
that wax wane lover eyes
thou human thought art nourishment
lik dark die flame
depart thi shadow came
depart not—lest grave be
lik life fear dark reality

whil yet boy sought ghost sped
through mani listen chamber cave ruin
and starlight wood fear step pursuing
hop high talk depart dead
i calld poison name youth fed
i heard saw not
when muse deepli lot
of life sweet time wind wooing
al vital thing wake bring
new bird blossoming
sudden thi shadow fell me
i shriekd claspd hand ecstasy

i vowd would dedic powers
to thee thine kept vow
with beat heart stream eye even now
i call phantom thousand hours
each voiceless grave visiond bowers
of studious zeal love delight
outwatchd envious night
they know never joy illumd brow
unlinkd hope thou wouldst free
thi world dark slavery
that thou aw loveliness
wouldst give whateer word cannot express

th day becom solemn serene
when noon past harmony
in autumn lustr sky
which summer heard seen
a could been
thus let thi power like truth
of natur passiv youth
descend onward life supply
it calm one worship thee

solitud pain heart distress poverty

mi whole life live pleasant thought
a life busi summer mood
a need thing would come unsought
to genial faith still rich genial good
but expect other should
build sow call
lov take heed all

i thought chatterton marvel boy
th sleepless soul perish pride
of walk glori joy
follow plough along mountainside
bi spirit deified
w poet youth begin gladness
but thereof come end despond madness

now whether peculiar grace
a lead someth given
yet befel lone place
when untoward thought striven
besid pool bare eye heaven
i saw man unawares
th oldest man seem ever wore grey hairs

a huge stone sometim seen lie
couch bald top eminence
wond espy
bi mean could thither come whence
so seem thing endu sense
lik seabeast crawl forth shelf
of rock sand reposeth sun itself

such seem man aliv dead
nor asleep—in extrem old age
hi bodi bent doubl foot head
com togeth life pilgrimage
a dire constraint pain rage
of sick felt time long past
a human weight upon frame cast

himself prop limb bodi pale face
upon long grey staff shaven wood
and still drew near gentl pace
upon margin moorish flood
motionless cloud old man stood
that heareth loud wind call
and moveth togeth move all

at length unsettl pond
stir staff fix look
upon muddi water conned
a read book
and stranger privileg took
and draw side say
thi morn give u promis glorious day

a gentl answer old man make
in courteous speech forth slowli drew
and word thus bespake
what occup pursue
thi lonesom place one like you
er repli flash mild surprise
brok sabl orb yetvivid eyes

hi word came feebli feebl chest
but solemn order follow each
with someth lofti utter drest—
choic word measur phrase reach
of ordinari men state speech
such grave liver scotland use
religi men give god man dues

h told water come
to gather leech old poor
employ hazard wearisome
and mani hardship endure
from pond pond roam moor moor
hous god good help choic chance
and way gain honest maintenance

th old man still stood talk side
but voic like stream
scarc heard word word could divide
and whole bodi man seem
lik one met dream
or like man far region sent
to give human strength apt admonishment

mi former thought return fear kills
and hope unwil fed
cold pain labour flesh ills
and mighti poet miseri dead
—perplex long comforted
mi question eager renew
how live do

h smile word repeat
and said gather leech far wide
h travel stir thus feet
th water pool abide
onc could meet everi side
but dwindl long slow decay
yet still persever find may

whil talk thus lone place
th old man shape speech—al troubl me
in mind eye seem see pace
about weari moor continually
wand alon silently
whil thought within pursued
h made paus discours renewed

and soon matter blended
ch utter demeanour kind
but state main ended
i could laugh scorn find
in decrepit man firm mind
god said help stay secure

i rode one even count maddalo
upon bank land break flow
of adria toward venic bare strand
of hillock heapd evershift sand
mat thistl amphibi weeds
such earth embrac salt ooz breeds
i uninhabit seaside
which lone fisher net dried
abandon object breaks
th wast one dwarf tree stakes
broken unrepaird tide makes
a narrow space level sand thereon
wher twas wont ride day went down
thi ride delight love waste
and solitari place taste
th pleasur believ see
i boundless wish soul be
and wide ocean shore
mor barren billow yet more
than rememberd friend love
to ride rode wind drove
th live spray along sunni air
into face blue heaven bare
strippd depth awaken north
and wave sound like delight broke forth
harmon solitud sent
into heart aëreal merriment
so rode talkd swift thought
wing laughter lingerd not
but flew brain brain—such glee ours
chargd light memori rememberd hours
non slow enough sad till came
homeward alway make spirit tame
thi day cheer cold now
th sun sink wind also
our talk grew somewhat serious may be
talk interrupt raillery
a mock cannot scorn
th thought would extinguish twas forlorn
yet pleas poet tell
th devil held within dale hell

pavd imag sky hoar
and aëri alp toward north appeard
through mist heavensustain bulwark reard
between east west half sky

dark purpl zenith still grew
down steep west wondrous hue
bright burn gold even rent
wher swift sun yet pausd descent
among manyfold hill were
thos famous euganean hill bear
a seen lido thro harbour piles
th like clump peakèd isles—
and then—a earth sea been
dissolvd one lake fire seen

which call maniac one cell
to vesper much skill need pray
in thank hope dark lot they

and like black dreari bell soul

our thought desir meet below
round rent heart pray—a madman do
for know not—til night death
a sunset strang vision severeth
our memori u all

and black bell becam invisible
and red tower lookd gray between

th orang hue heaven sunk silently

th follow morn raini cold dim
er maddalo aros calld him
and whilst wait child playd
a loveli toy sweet natur never made
a serious subtl wild yet gentl being
grac without design unforeseeing
with eyes—oh speak eyes—which seem
twin mirror italian heaven yet gleam
with deep mean never see
but human counten me
sh special favourit nursd
her fine feebl limb came first
to bleak world yet seemd know
on second sight ancient playfellow
less changd six month so
for first shyness worn out
w sate roll billiard ball about
when count enterd salut past—
th word spoke last night might well cast
a dark spirit—if man be
th passiv thing say see
much harm religion old saws
though may never leaden laws
which break teachless natur yoke
min anoth faith—thus much spoke
and note repli ad see
thi love child blith innoc free
sh spend happi time littl care
whil sick thought subject are
a came last night will
that thus enchain u permit ill
w might otherwis might all
w dream happi high majestical
wher love beauti truth seek
but mind weak
should le deed desire
ay weak—and aspire
how vain strong said maddalo
you talk utopia remain know

how strong chain spirit bind

who reignd religion made men blind
and suffer suffer kind
yet feel faith religion dear friend
said maddalo judgement bend

a far word go knew one like you
who citi came month ago
with argud sort he
