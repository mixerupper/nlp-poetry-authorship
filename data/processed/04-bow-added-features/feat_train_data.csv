among mountain winter sea
until king arthur tabl man man
had fallen lyonness lord
k arthur wound deep
th bold sir bediver uplift him
sir bediver last knights
and bore chapel nigh field
a broken chancel broken cross
that stood dark strait barren land
on one side lay ocean one
lay great water moon full

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
th sequel today unsold all
th goodliest fellowship famous knights
whereof world hold record sleep
they sleep—th men love think we
shal never futur time
delight soul talk knight deeds
walk garden halls
of camelot day were
i perish peopl made—
tho merlin sware come again
to rule more—but let be
i deepli smitten thro helm
that without help cannot last till morn
thou therefor take brand excalibur
which pride thou rememberest how
in old day one summer noon arm
ros bosom lake
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
hold sword—and rowd across
and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
in aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere
watch thou seëst light bring word

to repli bold sir bedivere
it meet sir king leav thee thus
aidless alon smitten thro helm
a littl thing may harm wound man
yet thi hest perform full
watch see light bring thee word

so say ruind shrine stept
and moon athwart place tombs
wher lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shril chill flake foam step down
bi zigzag path jut point rock
cam shine level lake

ther drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon
brighten skirt long cloud ran forth
and sparkl keen frost hilt
for haft twinkl diamond sparks

of subtlest jewelleri gaze long
that eye dazzl stood

so strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
hast thou performd mission gave
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard rippl wash reeds
and wild water lap crag

to repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betrayd thi natur thi name

thi fealti like nobl knight
for surer sign followd either hand
or voic els motion mere

i bade thee watch light bring word

then went sir bediver second time
across ridg pace besid mere

how curious strang chase smote
hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sur precious thing one worthi note

som one might show joust arms
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nin year wrought sit deeps
upon hidden base hills
so might old man speak aftertime
to peopl win reverence
but much honour much fame lost

so spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

then spoke king arthur breath heavily
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur much wrath
ah miser unkind untrue

and third time may prosper get thee hence
but thou spare fling excalibur

then quick rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg light plunged
among bulrushb clutchd sword
and strong wheeld threw great brand
mad lightn splendour moon
and flash round round whirld arch
shot like streamer northern morn

bi night nois northern sea
so flashd fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
and caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere
and light went king

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done

and answer made bold sir bedivere
sir king close mine eyelid lest gems

not tho live three life mortal men
so great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel him
but lookd behold arm

and answer made king arthur breath hard
mi end draw nigh time gone
mak broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
mi wound hath taken cold shall die

so say pavement half rose
slowli pain reclin arm
and look wist wide blue eyes
a pictur sir bedivere
remors regard thro tears
and would spoken found words
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hands
and rise bore thro place tombs

but walkd king arthur pant hard
lik one feel nightmar bed
when hous mute sighd king
mutt murmur ear quick quick
i fear late shall die
but swift strode ridg ridge

or clot point hang loose
mixd knight growth fring lips
so like shatterd column lay king
not like arthur lanc rest
from spur plume star tournament

then loud cri bold sir bedivere
ah lord arthur whither shall go
wher shall hide forehead eyes
for see true old time dead
when everi morn brought nobl chance
and everi chanc brought nobl knight
such time sinc light led

and slowli answerd arthur barge
th old order changeth yield place new
and god fulfil mani ways
lest one good custom corrupt world
comfort thyself comfort me
i live life done
may within make pure thou
if thou shouldst never see face again
pray soul thing wrought prayer
than world dream wherefor let thi voice

for men better sheep goats
that nourish blind life within brain
if know god lift hand prayer
both call friend
for whole round earth everi way

for mind cloud doubt

and infern god mid shade forlorn
of night slaughter lord required

then spake king arthur sir bedivere

that without help cannot last till morn

which pride thou rememberest how

and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
in aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere

to repli bold sir bedivere
it meet sir king leav thee thus
aidless alon smitten thro helm—
a littl thing may harm wound man

watch see light bring thee word

so say ruind shrine stept
and moon athwart place tombs
wher lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shril chill flake foam step down
bi zigzag path jut point rock
cam shine level lake

ther drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon

and sparkl keen frost hilt

so strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
hast thou performd mission gave

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard rippl wash reeds
and wild water lap crag

to repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betrayd thi natur thi name

for surer sign followd either hand
or voic els motion mere

i bade thee watch light bring word

then went sir bediver second time
across ridg pace besid mere
count dewi pebbl fixd thought
but saw wonder hilt
how curious strang chase smote
hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sur precious thing one worthi note

which might pleas eye mani men
what good follow done

what record relic lord
should aftertim empti breath
and rumour doubt kept
stor treasurehous mighti kings
som one might show joust arms
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nin year wrought sit deeps
upon hidden base hills
so might old man speak aftertime
to peopl win reverence
but much honour much fame lost

so spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

then spoke king arthur breath heavily
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur much wrath
ah miser unkind untrue
unknight traitorheart woe me
author forget die king
laid widowd power eye
that bowd see thee thou art
for thou latestleft knights
in meet offic all
thou wouldst betray precious hilt
eith lust gold like girl
valu giddi pleasur eyes
yet man may fail duti twice
and third time may prosper get thee hence
but thou spare fling excalibur
i aris slay thee hands

then quick rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg light plunged
among bulrush bed clutchd sword
and strong wheeld threw great brand
mad lightn splendour moon
and flash round round whirld arch
shot like streamer northern morn
seen move isl winter shock
bi night nois northern sea
so flashd fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
and caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere
and light went king

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done
speak thou hast heard seen

and answer made bold sir bedivere
sir king close mine eyelid lest gems
should blind purpos never saw
nor shall see elsewher till die
not tho live three life mortal men
so great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel him
but lookd behold arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
that caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere

and answer made king arthur breath hard
mi end draw nigh ti time gone
mak broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
mi wound hath taken cold shall die

so say pavement half rose
slowli pain reclin arm
and look wist wide blue eyes
a pictur sir bedivere
remors regard thro tears
and would spoken found words
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hands
and rise bore thro place tombs

but walkd king arthur pant hard
lik one feel nightmar bed
when hous mute sighd king
mutt murmur ear quick quick
i fear late shall die
but swift strode ridg ridge
cloth breath look walkd
larg human frozen hills
h heard deep behind cry
befor thought drove like goad
dri clashd har ici caves
and barren chasm left right
th bare black cliff clangd round based
hi foot jut slipperi crag rang
sharpsmitten dint arm heels—
and sudden lo level lake
and long glori winter moon

then saw hove duski barge
dark funer scarf stem stern
beneath descend ware
that deck dens state forms
blackstol blackhood like dream—bi these
thre queen crown gold rose
a cri shiverd tingl stars
and one voic agony
of lament like wind shrills
al night wast land one comes
or hath come sinc make world

then murmurd arthur place barge
so barg came three queens
put forth hand took king wept
but rose tallest all
and fairest laid head upon lap
and loos shatterd casqu chafe hands
and calld name complain loud
and drop bitter tear brow
strip dark blood face white
and colourless like witherd moon
smot fresh beam spring east
and greav cuiss dashd drops
of onset light lustrous curls—
that made forehead like rise sun
high daïsthrone—wer parchd dust
or clot point hang loose
mixd knight growth fring lips
so like shatterd column lay king
not like arthur lanc rest
from spur plume star tournament
shot thro list camelot charged
befor eye ladi kings

then loud cri bold sir bedivere
ah lord arthur whither shall go
wher shall hide forehead eyes
for see true old time dead
when everi morn brought nobl chance
and everi chanc brought nobl knight
such time sinc light led
th holi elder gift myrrh
but whole round tabl dissolved
which imag mighti world
and last go forth companionless
and day darken round years
among new men strang face minds

and slowli answerd arthur barge
th old order changeth yield place new
and god fulfil mani ways
lest one good custom corrupt world
comfort thyself comfort me
i live life done
may within make pure thou
if thou shouldst never see face again
pray soul thing wrought prayer
than world dream wherefor let thi voice
ris like fountain night day
for men better sheep goats
that nourish blind life within brain
if know god lift hand prayer
both call friend
for whole round earth everi way
bound gold chain foot god
but farewel go long way
with thou seëst—if inde go
for mind cloud doubt—
to islandvalley avilion
wher fall hail rain snow
nor ever wind blow loud lies
deepmeadowd happi fair orchard lawns
and boweri hollow crownd summer sea
wher heal grievous wound

so said barg oar sail
mov brink like fullbreast swan
that flute wild carol ere death
ruffl pure cold plume take flood
with swarthi web long stood sir bedivere
revolv mani memori till hull
lookd one black dot verg dawn
and mere wail die away

but moan past evermore

and therewith came weird rhyme

h pass king among dead
and heal grievous wound
h come but—if come more—
o yon dark queen yon black boat
who shriekd waild three whereat gazed

then dawn seemd came faint

lik last echo born great cry

mi old remembr went wholly
and way men vain melancholy

but sometim chanceth might
of joy mind go
a high mount delight
in deject sink low
to morn happen so
and fear fanci thick upon came
dim sadness—and blind thought knew could name

i heard skylark warbl sky
and bethought play hare
even happi child earth i
even bliss creatur fare
far world walk care
but may come anoth day me—
solitud pain heart distress poverty

mi whole life live pleasant thought
a life busi summer mood
a need thing would come unsought
to genial faith still rich genial good
but expect other should
build sow call
lov take heed all

i thought chatterton marvel boy
th sleepless soul perish pride
of walk glori joy
follow plough along mountainside
bi spirit deified
w poet youth begin gladness
but thereof come end despond madness

now whether peculiar grace
a lead someth given
yet befel lone place
when untoward thought striven
besid pool bare eye heaven
i saw man unawares
th oldest man seem ever wore grey hairs

a huge stone sometim seen lie

bi mean could thither come whence
so seem thing endu sense

such seem man aliv dead
nor asleep—in extrem old age
hi bodi bent doubl foot head
com togeth life pilgrimage
a dire constraint pain rage
of sick felt time long past
a human weight upon frame cast

himself prop limb bodi pale face
upon long grey staff shaven wood
and still drew near gentl pace
upon margin moorish flood
motionless cloud old man stood
that heareth loud wind call
and moveth togeth move all

at length unsettl pond

upon muddi water conned
a read book
and stranger privileg took
and draw side say

a gentl answer old man make
in courteous speech forth slowli drew
and word thus bespake

hi word came feebli feebl chest
but solemn order follow each
with someth lofti utter drest—

of ordinari men state speech
such grave liver scotland use

h told water come
to gather leech old poor
employ hazard wearisome
and mani hardship endure
from pond pond roam moor moor
hous god good help choic chance
and way gain honest maintenance

th old man still stood talk side
but voic like stream
scarc heard word word could divide
and whole bodi man seem
lik one met dream
or like man far region sent
to give human strength apt admonishment

mi former thought return fear kills
and hope unwil fed

and soon matter blended
