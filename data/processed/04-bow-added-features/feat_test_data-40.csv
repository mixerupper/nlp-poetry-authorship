seem'd light foot along garden walk
and shook heart think come more
but even heard close door

in long breez stream thi delici east
sigh lebanon

upon pastor slope fair

and look south fed
with honey rain delic air
and haunt starri head
of whose gentl chang fate
and made life perfum altarframe
and thi dark must spread
with delight old thi great
forefath thornless garden there

and fair star crown happi day

a seem far better born
to labour mattockharden hand
than nurs eas brought understand
a sad astrolog boundless plan
that make tyrant iron skies
innumer pitiless passionless eyes

and accept mad would die

and die live long puls play
