"went forest searching
for fire insid plead wood
but can't say long
i moor worlds
i heard magpi rumination
but don't know wings
lift moon let drift
slow littl straw boat
set ablaz wind river
i learn yellowey wolf
i dog amp man small boy
with star pin sleeve
wa hide among thorn bushes
or restless dark
wound pale linden tree
outsid warsaw apartment
night crawl stone
quick cri held throat
al rememb left hand
wa hold right breast
when forc eye shut
then could hear something
in room magnanimous
but small half outsid amp half
insid song—
an insomniac one prophecy
press curtains

"this—yarrow—thi stream
of fanci cherished
so faith wake dream
an imag hath perished
o minstrel harp near
to utter note gladness
and chase silenc air
that fill heart sadness

yet why—a silveri current flows
with uncontrol meanderings
nor eye greener hills
been sooth wanderings
and depth saint mari lake
i visibl delighted
for featur hills
i mirror slighted

a blue sky bend oer yarrow vale
sav pear whiteness
i round rise sun diffused
a tender hazi brightness
mild dawn promis excludes
al profitless dejection
though unwil admit
a pensiv recollection

wher famous flower
of yarrow vale lay bleeding
hi bed perchanc yon smooth mound
on herd feeding
and hapli crystal pool
now peac morning
th waterwraith ascend thrice—
and gave dole warning

delici lay sings
th haunt happi lovers
th path lead grove
th leafi grove covers
and piti sanctifi verse
that paint strength sorrow
th unconquer strength love
bear wit rueful yarrow

but thou didst appear fair
to fond imagination
dost rival light day
her delic creation
meek loveli round thee spread
a soft still holy
th grace forest charm decayed
and pastor melancholy

that region left vale unfolds
rich grove lofti stature
with yarrow wind pomp
of cultiv nature
and rise lofti groves
behold ruin hoary
th shatter front newark towers
renown border story

fair scene childhood open bloom
for sportiv youth stray in
for manhood enjoy strength
and age wear away in
yon cottag seem bower bliss
a covert protection
of tender thought nestl there—
th brood chast affection

how sweet autumn day
th wildwood fruit gather
and truelov forehead plant
a crest bloom heather
and enwreath own
twer offenc reason
th sober hill thus deck brows
to meet wintri season

i see—but sight alone
lov yarrow thee
a ray fanci still survives—
h sunshin play upon thee
thi everyouth water keep
a cours live pleasure
and gladsom note lip breathe
accord measure

th vapour linger round heights
they melt soon must vanish
on hour mine—
sad thought would banish
but know whereer go
thi genuin imag yarrow
wil dwell me—to heighten joy

o wild west wind thou breath autumn being
thou whose unseen presenc leaf dead
ar driven like ghost enchant fleeing

yellow black pale hectic red
pestilencestricken multitud thou
who chariotest dark wintri bed

th wing seed lie cold low
each like corps within grave until
thin azur sister spring shall blow

her clarion oer dream earth fill
driv sweet bud like flock feed air
with live hue odour plain hill

wild spirit art move everywhere

thou whose stream mid steep sky commotion
loos cloud like earth decay leaf shed
shook tangl bough heaven ocean

angel rain lightn spread
on blue surfac thine aëri surge
lik bright hair uplift head

of fierc maenad even dim verge
of horizon zenith height
th lock approach storm thou dirge

of die year close night
wil dome vast sepulchre

of vapour whose solid atmosphere
black rain fire hail burst oh hear

besid pumic isl baiae bay
and saw sleep old palac towers
quiv within wave intens day

al overgrown azur moss flowers
so sweet sens faint pictur thou
for whose path atlant level powers

if swift cloud fli thee

scarc seemd vision would neer striven

a thus thee prayer sore need
oh lift wave leaf cloud

"bring fresh shower thirst flowers
from sea streams
i bear light shade leaf laid
in noonday dreams
from wing shaken dew waken
th sweet bud everi one
when rock rest mother breast
a danc sun
i wield flail lash hail
and whiten green plain under
and dissolv rain
and laugh pas thunder

i sift snow mountain below
and great pine groan aghast
and night ti pillow white
whil sleep arm blast
sublim tower skiey bowers
lightn pilot sits
in cavern fetter thunder
it struggl howl fits
ov earth ocean gentl motion
thi pilot guid me

in depth purpl sea
ov rill crag hills
ov lake plains
wherev dream mountain stream
th spirit love remains
and bask heaven blue smile
whilst dissolv rains

th sanguin sunris meteor eyes
and burn plume outspread
leap back sail rack
when morn star shine dead
a jag mountain crag
which earthquak rock swings
an eagl alit one moment may sit
in light golden wings
and sunset may breath lit sea beneath
it ardour rest love
and crimson pall eve may fall
from depth heaven above
with wing fold rest mine aëri nest
a still brood dove

that orbèd maiden white fire laden
whom mortal call moon
glid glimmer oer fleecelik floor
bi midnight breez strewn
and wherev beat unseen feet
which angel hear
may broken woof tent thin roof
th star peep behind peer
and laugh see whirl flee
lik swarm golden bees
when widen rent windbuilt tent

i bind sun throne burn zone
and moon girdl pearl
th volcano dim star reel swim
when whirlwind banner unfurl
from cape cape bridgelik shape
ov torrent sea

th mountain column be
th triumphal arch march
with hurrican fire snow
when power air chain chair

"thi neighbour thou rug pile
four summer week dwelt sight thee
i saw thee everi day while
thi form sleep glassi sea

so pure sky quiet air
so like like day day
when look thi imag still there
it trembl never pass away

how perfect calm seem sleep
no mood season take away brings
i could fanci mighti deep
wa even gentlest gentl things

ahthen mine painter hand
to express saw add gleam
th light never sea land
th consecr poet dream

i would plant thee thou hoari pile
amid world differ this
besid sea could ceas smile
on tranquil land beneath sky bliss

thou shouldst seem treasurehous divine
of peac year chronicl heaven—
of sunbeam ever shine
th sweetest thee given

a pictur last ease
elysian quiet without toil strife
no motion move tide breeze
or mere silent natur breath life

such fond illus heart
such pictur would time made
and seen soul truth everi part
a steadfast peac might betrayed

so would been—ti more
i submit new control
a power gone noth restore
a deep distress hath humanis soul

not moment could behold
a smile sea been
th feel loss neer old
thi know speak mind serene

then beaumont friend would friend
if live deplore
thi work thine blame commend
thi sea anger dismal shore

o ti passion work—yet wise well
wel chosen spirit here
that hulk labour dead swell
thi rueful sky pageantri fear

and huge castl stand sublime
i love see look braves
cas unfeel armour old time
th lightn fierc wind trampl waves

farewel farewel heart life alone
h dream distanc kind
such happi wherev known
i piti ti sure blind

but welcom fortitud patient cheer
and frequent sight borne
such sight wors here—
