"old man bend come among new faces
year look backward resum answer children
com tell u old man young men maiden love me
arous'd angri i'd thought beat alarum urg relentless war
but soon finger fail'd face droop'd resign'd myself
to sit wound sooth silent watch dead
year henc scene furious passion chances
of unsurpass'd hero one side brave equal brave
now wit paint mightiest armi earth
of armi rapid wondrous saw tell us
what stay latest deepest curious panics
of hardfought engag sieg tremend deepest remains




o maiden young men love love me
what ask day strangest sudden talk recalls
soldi alert arriv long march cover'd sweat dust
in nick time come plung fight loud shout rush success charge
ent captur'd works—yet lo like swift run river fade
pass gone fade—i dwell soldier peril soldier joys
both rememb well—mani hardship joy yet content

but silenc dream projections
whil world gain appear mirth go on
so soon forgotten wave wash imprint sand
with hing knee return enter door there
whoev follow without nois strong heart

bear bandag water sponge
straight swift wound go
wher lie ground battl brought in
wher priceless blood redden grass ground
or row hospit tent roof'd hospital
to long row cot side return
to one anoth draw near one miss
an attend follow hold tray carri refus pail
soon fill'd clot rag blood empti fill'd again

i onward go stop
with hing knee steadi hand dress wounds
i firm pang sharp yet unavoidable
on turn appeal eyes—poor boy never knew you
yet think could refus moment die would save you




on go open door time open hospit doors
th crush'd head dress poor craze hand tear bandag away

i dress perfor shoulder foot bulletwound
cleans one gnaw putrid gangren sicken offensive
whil attend stand behind asid hold tray pail

i faith give out

"day long nois battl rolld
among mountain winter sea
until king arthur tabl man man
had fallen lyonness lord
k arthur wound deep
th bold sir bediver uplift him
sir bediver last knights
and bore chapel nigh field
a broken chancel broken cross
that stood dark strait barren land
on one side lay ocean one
lay great water moon full

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
th sequel today unsold all
th goodliest fellowship famous knights
whereof world hold record sleep
they sleep—th men love think we
shal never futur time
delight soul talk knight deeds
walk garden halls
of camelot day were
i perish peopl made—
tho merlin sware come again
to rule more—but let be
i deepli smitten thro helm
that without help cannot last till morn
thou therefor take brand excalibur
which pride thou rememberest how
in old day one summer noon arm
ros bosom lake
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
hold sword—and rowd across
and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
in aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere
watch thou seëst light bring word

to repli bold sir bedivere
it meet sir king leav thee thus
aidless alon smitten thro helm
a littl thing may harm wound man
yet thi hest perform full
watch see light bring thee word

so say ruind shrine stept
and moon athwart place tombs
wher lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shril chill flake foam step down
bi zigzag path jut point rock
cam shine level lake

ther drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon
brighten skirt long cloud ran forth
and sparkl keen frost hilt
for haft twinkl diamond sparks
myriad topazlight jacinth work
of subtlest jewelleri gaze long
that eye dazzl stood
thi way divid swift mind
in act throw last seemd
bett leav excalibur conceald
ther manyknot waterflags
that whistl stiff dri marge
so strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
hast thou performd mission gave
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard rippl wash reeds
and wild water lap crag

to repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betrayd thi natur thi name
not render true answer beseemd
thi fealti like nobl knight
for surer sign followd either hand
or voic els motion mere
thi shame thing men lie
yet charg thee quick go again
a thou art lief dear thing
i bade thee watch light bring word

then went sir bediver second time
across ridg pace besid mere
count dewi pebbl fix thought
but saw wonder hilt
how curious strang chase smote
hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sur precious thing one worthi note
should thus lost forev earth
which might pleas eye mani men
what good follow done
what harm undon deep harm disobey
se obedi bond rule
wer well obey king demand
an act unprofit himself
th king sick know does
what record relic lord
should aftertim empti breath
and rumour doubt kept
stor treasurehous mighti kings
som one might show joust arms
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nin year wrought sit deeps
upon hidden base hills
so might old man speak aftertime
to peopl win reverence
but much honour much fame lost

so spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

then spoke king arthur breath heavily
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur much wrath
ah miser unkind untrue
unknight traitorheart woe me
author forget die king
laid widowd power eye
that bowd see thee thou art
for thou latestleft knights
in meet offic all
thou wouldst betray precious hilt
eith lust gold like girl
valu giddi pleasur eyes
yet man may fail duti twice
and third time may prosper get thee hence
but thou spare fling excalibur
i aris slay thee hands

then quick rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg light plunged
among bulrushb clutchd sword
and strong wheeld threw great brand
mad lightn splendour moon
and flash round round whirld arch
shot like streamer northern morn
seen move isl winter shock
bi night nois northern sea
so flashd fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
and caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere
and light went king

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done
speak thou hast heard seen

and answer made bold sir bedivere
sir king close mine eyelid lest gems
should blind purpos never saw
nor shall see elsewher till die
not tho live three life mortal men
so great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel him
but lookd behold arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
that caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere

and answer made king arthur breath hard
mi end draw nigh time gone
mak broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
mi wound hath taken cold shall die

so say pavement half rose
slowli pain reclin arm
and look wist wide blue eyes
a pictur sir bedivere
remors regard thro tears
and would spoken found words
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hands
and rise bore thro place tombs

but walkd king arthur pant hard
lik one feel nightmar bed
when hous mute sighd king
mutt murmur ear quick quick
i fear late shall die
but swift strode ridg ridge
cloth breath look walkd
larg human frozen hills
h heard deep behind cry
befor thought drove like goad
dri clashd har ici caves
and barren chasm left right
th bare black cliff clangd round based
hi foot jut slipperi crag rang
sharpsmitten dint arm heels—
and sudden lo level lake
and long glori winter moon

then saw hove duski barge
dark funer scarf stem stern
beneath descend ware
that deck dens state forms
blackstol blackhood like dream—bi these
thre queen crown gold—and rose
a cri shiverd tingl stars
and one voic agony
of lament like wind shrills
al night wast land one comes
or hath come sinc make world

then murmurd arthur place barge
and barg came three queens
put forth hand took king wept
but rose tallest all
and fairest laid head upon lap
and loos shatterd casqu chafe hands
and calld name complain loud
and drop bitter tear brow
strip dark blood face white
and colourless like witherd moon
smot fresh beam spring east
and greav cuiss dashd drops
of onset light lustrous curls—
that made forehead like rise sun
high daïsthrone—wer parchd dust
or clot point hang loose
mixd knight growth fring lips
so like shatterd column lay king
not like arthur lanc rest
from spur plume star tournament
shot thro list camelot charged
befor eye ladi kings

then loud cri bold sir bedivere
ah lord arthur whither shall go
wher shall hide forehead eyes
for see true old time dead
when everi morn brought nobl chance
and everi chanc brought nobl knight
such time sinc light led
th holi elder gift myrrh
but whole round tabl dissolved
which imag mighti world
and last go forth companionless
and day darken round years
among new men strang face minds

and slowli answerd arthur barge
th old order changeth yield place new
and god fulfil mani ways
lest one good custom corrupt world
comfort thyself comfort me
i live life done
may within make pure thou
if thou shouldst never see face again
pray soul thing wrought prayer
than world dream wherefor let thi voice
ris like fountain night day
for men better sheep goats
that nourish blind life within brain
if know god lift hand prayer
both call friend
for whole round earth everi way
bound gold chain foot god
but farewel go long way
with thou seëst—if inde go—
for mind cloud doubt
to islandvalley avilion
wher fall hail rain snow
nor ever wind blow loud lies
deepmeadowd happi fair orchardlawns
and boweri hollow crownd summer sea
wher heal grievous wound

so said barg oar sail
mov brink like fullbreast swan
that flute wild carol ere death
ruffl pure cold plume take flood
with swarthi web long stood sir bedivere

and thro waver light shadow broke
rol slumbrous sheet foam below
they saw gleam river seaward flow
from inner land far three mountaintops

"comrad leav littl yet earli morn
leav want sound upon buglehorn

t place around old curlew call
dreari gleam moorland fli locksley hall

locksley hall distanc overlook sandi tracts
and hollow oceanridg roar cataracts

mani night yonder ivi casement ere went rest
did look great orion slope slowli west

mani night saw pleiad rise thro mellow shade
glitt like swarm firefli tangl silver braid

her beach wanderd nourish youth sublime
with fairi tale scienc long result time

when centuri behind like fruit land reposed
when clung present promis closed

when dipt futur far human eye could see
saw vision world wonder would be—

in spring fuller crimson come upon robin breast
in spring wanton lapw get anoth crest

in spring liveli iri chang burnishd dove
in spring young man fanci light turn thought love

then cheek pale thinner one young
and eye motion mute observ hung

and said cousin ami speak speak truth me
trust cousin current set thee

on pallid cheek forehead came colour light
a seen rosi red flush northern night

and turnd—her bosom shaken sudden storm sighs—
al spirit deepli dawn dark hazel eyes—

say hid feel fear wrong
say dost thou love cousin weep love thee long

lov took glass time turnd glow hands
everi moment light shaken ran golden sands

lov took harp life smote chord might
smot chord self trembl passd music sight

mani morn moorland hear cops ring
and whisper throngd puls ful spring

mani even water watch state ships
and spirit rushd togeth touch lips

o cousin shallowheart ami mine more
o dreari dreari moorland barren barren shore

fals fanci fathom falser song sung

i well wish thee happy—hav known me—to decline

yet shall thou shalt lower level day day
what fine within thee grow coars sympath clay

a husband wife thou art mate clown
and gross natur weight drag thee down

h hold thee passion shall spent novel force

h answer purpos easi thing understand—
bett thou wert dead tho slew thee hand

bett thou lie hidden heart disgrace

curs social want sin strength youth
curs social lie warp u live truth

curs sick form err honest natur rule
curs gold gild straitend forehead fool

well—t well bluster—hadst thou le unworthi proved—
would god—for love thee ever wife loved

am mad cherish bear bitter fruit
i pluck bosom tho heart root

nev tho mortal summer length year come
a manywinterd crow lead clang rookeri home

wher comfort divis record mind
can part love knew kind

i rememb one perishd sweet speak move
such one rememb look love

can think dead love love bore
no—sh never love truli love love evermore

comfort comfort scornd devil truth poet sings
that sorrow crown sorrow rememb happier things

drug thi memori lest thou learn lest thi heart put proof
in dead unhappi night rain roof

lik dog hunt dream thou art stare wall
wher die nightlamp flicker shadow rise fall

then hand shall pas thee point drunken sleep
to thi widowd marriagepillow tear thou wilt weep

thou shalt hear never never whisperd phantom years
and song distanc ring thine ears

and eye shall vex thee look ancient kind thi pain
turn thee turn thee thi pillow get thee thi rest again

nay natur bring thee solac tender voic cry
t purer life thine lip drain thi troubl dry

babi lip laugh latest rival bring thee rest
babi finger waxen touch press mother breast

o child cloth father dear due

o see thee old formal fit thi petti part
with littl hoard maxim preach daughter heart

when rank rolld vapour wind laid sound

and night along duski highway near nearer drawn
se heaven light london flare like dreari dawn

and spirit leap within gone then

thou art unseen yet hear thi shrill delight

keen arrows
of silver sphere
whos intens lamp narrows
in white dawn clear
until hard see feel there

al earth air
with thi voic loud
a night bare
from one lone cloud
th moon rain beam heaven overflowd

what thou art know not
what like thee
from rainbow cloud flow not
drop bright see
a thi presenc shower rain melody

lik poet hidden
in light thought
sing hymn unbidden
til world wrought
to sympathi hope fear heed not

lik highborn maiden
in palacetower
sooth loveladen
soul secret hour
with music sweet love overflow bower

lik glowworm golden
in dell dew
scatt unbeholden
it aereal hue
among flower grass screen view

lik rose embowerd
in green leaves
bi warm wind deflowerd
til scent gives
mak faint much sweet heavywing thieves

sound vernal showers
on twinkl grass
rainawakend flowers
al ever was
joy clear fresh thi music doth surpass

teach u sprite bird
what sweet thought thine
i never heard
prais love wine
that pant forth flood raptur divine

chorus hymeneal
or triumphal chant
matchd thine would all
but empti vaunt
a thing wherein feel hidden want

what object fountains
of thi happi strain
what field wave mountains
what shape sky plain
what love thine kind ignor pain

with thi clear keen joyance
languor cannot be
shadow annoyance
nev came near thee
thou lovest neer knew love sad satiety

wak asleep
thou death must deem
th true deep
than mortal dream
or could thi note flow crystal stream

w look after
and pine not
our sincerest laughter
with pain fraught
our sweetest song tell saddest thought

yet could scorn
hat pride fear
if thing born
not shed tear
i know thi joy ever come near

bett measures
of delight sound
bett treasures
that book found
thi skill poet thou scorner ground

teach half gladness
that thi brain must know
such harmoni madness
from lip would flow

"aris dream thee
in first sweet sleep night
when wind breath low
and star shine bright
i aris dream thee
and spirit feet
hath led me—who know how
to thi chamber window sweet

th wander air faint
on dark silent stream—
th champak odour fail
lik sweet thought dream
th nightingal complaint
it dy upon heart—
a must thine
oh belovèd thou art

oh lift grass
i die faint fail
let thi love kiss rain
on lip eyelid pale
mi cheek cold white alas

"shall compar thee summer day
thou art love temperate
rough wind shake darl bud may
and summer leas hath short date
sometim hot eye heaven shines
and often gold complexion dimmd
and everi fair fair sometim declines
bi chanc natur chang cours untrimmd
but thi etern summer shall fade
nor lose possess fair thou ow'st
nor shall death brag thou wander'st shade

an anatomi world
wherein
bi occas untim death mistress
elizabeth druri frailti decay
of whole world represented
th first anniversary
when rich soul heaven gone
whom celebr know one
for sure hath soul unless

and deed prais doth this
may lodg inmat soul ti his
when queen end progress time
and ther stand hous heaven climb
wher loath make saint attend long
sh part choir song
thi world great earthquak languished
for common bath tear bled
which drew strongest vital spirit out
but succourd perplex doubt
wheth world lose gain this
becaus sinc way is
but good see would see

thi great consumpt fever turnd
and world fit joyd mournd
and men think agu physic are
and th agu spent give care
so thou sick world mistakst thi self be

h death wound tame thee then
thou mightst better spard sun man
that wound deep ti misery
that thou hast lost thi sens memory
twa heavi hear thi voic moan
but wors thou art speechless grown
thou hast forgot thi name thou hadst thou wast
noth thou hast oerpast
for child kept font until
a princ expect long come fulfill
th ceremoni thou unnamd hadst laid
had come thee palac made
h name defind thee gave thee form frame
and thou forgetst celebr thi name
som month hath dead dead
measur time determined
but long sheath away long long yet none
off tell u that gone
but state doubt futur heirs
when sick without remedi impairs
th present princ theyr loath said
th princ doth languish princ dead
so mankind feel general thaw
a strong exampl gone equal law
th cement faith compact
and glue virtu resolvd slackd
thought blasphemi say shwa dead
or weak discovered
in confess therefor spoke more
than tongu soul gone loss deplore
but though late succour thee
sick world yea dead yea putrifi sinc she
thi intrins balm thi preservative
can never renewd thou never live
i sinc man make thee live try
what may gain thi anatomy
h death hath taught u dear thou art
corrupt mortal thi purest part
let man say world dead
ti labour lost discovered
th world infirm sinc none
al studi dissection
for there kind world remain still
though inanim fill
th world gone yet last long night
her ghost doth walk glimmer light
a faint weak love virtu good

and though thus element arm

for assumd unto dignity
so mani weedless paradis be
which produc venom sin
except foreign serpent bring in
yet outward storm strongest break
and strength confid grow weak
thi new world may safer told
th danger diseas old
for due temper men forgo
or covet thing true worth know
ther health physician say we
at best enjoy neutrality
and wors sick know
that never well so
w born ruinous poor mother cry
that child come right orderly
except headlong come fall upon
an omin precipitation
how witti ruin importunate
upon mankind labourd frustrate
even god purpos made woman sent
for man relief caus languishment
they good end still
but accessori princip ill
for first marriag funeral
on woman one blow killd u all
and singl one one kill u now
w delight self allow
to consumpt profus blind
w kill self propag kind
and yet men
ther mankind then
when sun man seem strive
joint tenant world survive
when stag raven longlivd tree
compard man die minority
when slowpacd star stoln away
from observ mark might stay
two three hundr year seet again
and make observ plain
when age long size great
man growth confessd recompensd meat
so spacious larg everi soul
did fair kingdom larg realm control
and statur thus erect
did soul good way toward heaven direct
wher mankind life age
fit made methusalem page
ala scarc live long enough try
wheth truemad clock run right lie
old grandsir talk yesterday sorrow
and child reserv tomorrow
so short life everi peasant strives
in torn hous field three lives
and last length man

for man first forest strayd
or shipwrackd sea one would laid

"sacrific rise morn
vow made fruitless hope inspired
and infern god mid shade forlorn
of night slaughter lord required
celesti piti implore—
restor sight—great jove restore

so speak fervent love endowed
with faith suppliant heavenward lift hands
whil like sun emerg cloud
her counten brightens—and eye expands
h bosom heav spread statur grows
a expect issu repose

o terror hath perceived—o joy
what doth look on—whom doth behold
h hero slain upon beach troy
hi vital presenc corpor mould
it is—if sens deceiv not—ti he
and god lead wingèd mercury

mild herm spake—and touch wand
that calm fear grace hath crown thi prayer
laodamía jove command
thi husband walk path upper air
h come tarri thee three hour space
accept gift behold face face

forth sprang impass queen lord clasp
again consumm essayed
but unsubstanti form elud grasp
a often eager grasp made
th phantom parts—but part reunite
and reassum place sight

protesiláus lo thi guid gone
confirm pray vision thi voice
thi palace—yond thi throne
speak floor thou treadst rejoice
not appal god bestowed
thi precious boon blest sad abode

great jove laodamía doth leave
hi gift imperfect—spectr though be
i sent scare thee deceive
but reward thi fidelity
and someth also worth obtain
for fearless virtu bringeth boundless gain

thou knowest delphic oracl foretold
that first greek touch trojan strand
should die threat could withhold
a generous caus victim demand
and forth leapt upon sandi plain
a selfdevot chief—bi hector slain

suprem heroes—bravest noblest best
thi matchless courag bewail more
which ten thousand deprest
bi doubt propel thee fatal shore
thou foundst—and forgiv thee—her thou art—

"five year past five summer length

of sportiv wood run wild pastor farms

"strong son god immort love

thou madest death lo thi foot

thou wilt leav u dust
thou madest man know why

and thou hast made thou art just

thou seemest human divine
th highest holiest manhood thou
our will know how

for merit life man man
and man lord thee

forg grief one removed

so summer task end mary
and return thee mine heart home
a queen victor knight fa
ë
ry
earn bright spoil inchant dome
nor thou disdain ere fame become
a star among star mortal night
if inde may cleav natal gloom
it doubt promis thus would unite
with thi belov name thou child love light



th toil stole thee mani hour
i ended—and fruit thi feet
no longer wood frame bower
with interlac branch mix meet
or sound like mani voic sweet
waterfal leap among wild island green
which frame lone boat lone retreat
of mossgrown tree weed shall seen
but besid thee still heart ever been



thought great deed mine dear friend first
th cloud wrap world youth pass
i rememb well hour burst
mi spirit sleep fresh maydawn was
when walk forth upon glitter grass
and wept knew rose
from near schoolroom voic alas
wer one echo world woes—
th harsh grate strife tyrant foes



and clasp hand look around—
—but none near mock stream eyes
which pour warm drop sunni ground—
so without shame spake—i wise
and free mild lies
such power grow weari behold
th selfish strong still tyrannise
without reproach check controuled
mi tear heart grew calm meek bold



and hour earnest thought
heap knowledg forbidden mine lore
yet noth tyrant knew taught
i care learn secret store
wrought link armour soul before
it might walk forth war among mankind
thus power hope strengthen more
within till came upon mind
a sens loneli thirst pined



ala love blight snare
to seek sympathi one—
such sought vain black despair
th shadow starless night thrown
ov world move alone—
yet never found one fals me
hard heart cold like weight ici stone
which crush wither mine could be
aught lifeless clog reviv thee



thou friend whose presenc wintri heart
fel like bright spring upon herbless plain
how beauti calm free thou wert
in thi young wisdom mortal chain
of custom thou didst burst rend twain
and walk free light cloud among
which mani envious slave breath vain
from dim dungeon spirit sprung
to meet thee woe begirt long



no alon world wilderness
although trod path high intent
i journey companionless
wher solitud like despair went—
ther wisdom stern content
when poverti blight good
when infami dare mock innocent
and cherish friend turn multitude
to trampl unshaken stood



now descend seren hour
and inconst fortun friend return
though suffer leaf knowledg power
which says—let scorn repaid scorn
and thi side two gentl babe born
to fill home smile thus we
most fortun beneath life beam morn
and delight thou me
th parent song consecr thee



i inexperienc fingers
but strike prelud loftier strain
or must lyre spirit lingers
soon paus silenc neer sound again
though might shake anarch custom reign
and charm mind men truth sway
holi amphion would fain
repli hope—but worn away
and death love yet contend prey



and art thou know dare speak
tim may interpret silent years
yet pale thi thought cheek
and light thine ampl forehead wears
and thi sweetest smile thi tears
and thi gentl speech prophecy
i whisper subdu fondest fears
and thine eye even thi soul see
a lamp vestal fire burn internally



they say thou wert love thi birth
of glorious parent thou aspir child
i wonder not—for one left earth
whos life like set planet mild
which cloth thee radianc undefiled
of depart glori still fame
shin thee tempest dark wild
which shake latter day thou canst claim
th shelter thi sire immort name



on voic came forth mani mighti spirit
which echo three thousand years
and tumultu world stood mute hear it
a lone man desart hears
th music home—unwont fears
fel pale oppressor race
and faith custom lowthought cares
lik thunderstricken dragon space
left torn human heart food dwellingplace



truth deathless voic paus among mankind
if must respons cry—
if men must rise stamp furi blind
on pure name love them—thou i
sweet friend look tranquillity
lik lamp world tempestu night—

but one throng bright roll worlds
which thou alon live things
behold sleepless eye regard earth
mad multitudin thi slave thou
requitest kneeworship prayer praise
and toil hecatomb broken hearts
with fear selfcontempt barren hope
whilst thi foe eyeless hate
hast thou made reign triumph thi scorn
oer mine miseri thi vain revenge
thre thousand year sleepunshelt hours
and moment aye divid keen pangs
til seem year tortur solitude
scorn despair—thes mine empire—
mor glorious far thou surveyest
from thine unenvi throne mighti god
almighti deign share shame
of thine ill tyranni hung here
nail wall eaglebaffl mountain
black wintri dead unmeasur without herb
insect beast shape sound life
ah ala pain pain ever ever

no chang paus hope yet endure
i ask earth mountain felt
i ask yon heaven allbehold sun
ha seen sea storm calm

hav deaf wave heard agony
ah ala pain pain ever ever

th crawl glacier pierc spears
of moonfreez crystal bright chains

hi beak poison tear up
mi heart shapeless sight come wander by
th ghast peopl realm dream
mock earthquakefiend charged
to wrench rivet quiver wounds
when rock split close behind
whil loud abyss howl throng
th genius storm urg rage
of whirlwind afflict keen hail
and yet welcom day night
wheth one break hoar frost morn
or starri dim slow climbs

th wingless crawl hour one among whom
—a dark priest hale reluct victim—
shal drag thee cruel king kiss blood
from pale foot might trampl thee
if disdain prostrat slave
disdain ah piti thee ruin
wil hunt thee undefend wide heaven
how thi soul cloven depth terror
gap like hell within speak grief
not exult hate more
a ere miseri made wise curse
onc breath thee would recal ye mountains
whos manyvoicèd echo mist
of cataract flung thunder spell
y ici spring stagnant wrinkl frost
which vibrat hear crept
shudd india thou serenest air
through sun walk burn without beams
and ye swift whirlwind poisèd wings
hung mute moveless oer yon hush abyss
a thunder louder made rock
th orbèd world word power
though chang aught evil wish

"stori bold sir bedivere
first made latest left knights
told man voice
in white winter age those
with dwelt new face minds

for march westward bedivere
who slowli pace among slumber host
heard tent moan king

i found shine stars

but way men find not

a lesser god made world
but forc shape would

a lone citi sackd night
when lost wife child wail
pass new lord arthur woke calld
who spake dream light upon wind
thin gawain voice—ar dim cries
thin doth haunt wast wild
mourn know go along me

thi heard bold sir bediver spake
o king let pas whatev will

but stead thi name glori cling

and care thou dream rise—
i hear step modr west
and mani thi peopl knights
onc thine thou hast love grosser grown
than heathen spit vow thee
right well heart know thee king
aris go forth conquer old

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
far battl west
whereto move strove youth
and brake petti king fought rome
or thrust heathen roman wall
and shook thro north ill doom mine
to war peopl knights
th king fight peopl fight himself
and knight love stroke
that strike dead death me
yet let u henc find feel way
thro blind haze ever sinc saw
on lie dust almesbury

then rose king move host night
and ever pushd sir modr leagu league
back sunset bound lyonnesse—
a land old upheaven abyss
bi fire sink abyss again
wher fragment forgotten peopl dwelt
and long mountain end coast
of evershift sand far away

ther pursuer could pursu more
and fled fli king
and day great light heaven
burnd lowest roll year
on wast sand wast sea closed
nor ever yet arthur fought fight
lik last dim weird battl west
a deathwhit mist slept sand sea
whereof chill breath drew
down blood till heart cold
with formless fear evn arthur fell
confus sinc saw fought

for friend foe shadow mist
and friend slew friend know slew
and vision golden youth
and beheld face old ghosts
look upon battl mist
wa mani nobl deed mani base
and chanc craft strength singl fights
and ever anon host host
shock splinter spear hard mail hewn
shieldbreak clash brand crash
of battleax shatterd helm shrieks
aft christ fall down
lookd heaven saw mist
and shout heathen traitor knights
oath insult filth monstrous blasphemies
sweat writh anguish labour lungs
in close mist cri light
moan die voic dead

last one deathb wail
of suffer silenc follow thro death
or deathlik swoon thus shore
sav whisper seeth seas
a dead hush fell dolor day
grew drearier toward twilight fall came
a bitter wind clear north blew
th mist asid wind tide
ros pale king glanc across field
of battl man move there
nor cri christian heard thereon
nor yet heathen wan wave
brak among dead face fro
sway helpless hand down
tumbl hollow helmet fallen
and shiverd brand fought rome
and roll far along gloomi shores
th voic day old day be

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
and whiter mist day long
had held field battl king

hearest thou great voic shake world
and wast narrow realm whereon move
and beat upon face dead
mi dead tho die me—
o bediver heart hath falln
confus till know am

then spake bold sir bediver king
k everywher dead kings
ther also worship thee king
yet still thi life whole still live
who love thee hate thee brought
th heathen back among u yonder stands
modr unharmd traitor thine house

then spake king hous hath doom
but call thou traitor house
who hath dwelt beneath one roof me
mi hous rather sware vows
yea even brake ownd king
and well thee say dark hour
when purport throne hath faild
that quick dead thou hottest king
k whatsoev cry
and one last act kinghood shalt thou see
yet ere pas utter king
mad man modr smote liege

so day long nois battl rolld
among mountain winter sea
until king arthur tabl man man
had falln lyonness lord
k arthur wound deep
th bold sir bediver uplift him
and bore chapel nigh field
a broken chancel broken cross
that stood dark strait barren land
on one side lay ocean one
lay great water moon full

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
th sequel today unsold all
th goodliest fellowship famous knights
whereof world hold record sleep
they sleep—th men love think we
shal never futur time
delight soul talk knight deeds
walk garden halls
of camelot day were
i perish peopl made—
tho merlin sware come again
to rule let be
i deepli smitten thro helm
that without help cannot last till morn
thou therefor take brand excalibur
which pride thou rememberest how
in old day one summer noon arm
ros bosom lake
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
hold sword—and rowd across
and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
in aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere
watch thou seëst light bring word

to repli bold sir bedivere
it meet sir king leav thee thus
aidless alon smitten thro helm—
a littl thing may harm wound man
yet thi hest perform full
watch see light bring thee word

so say ruind shrine stept
and moon athwart place tombs
wher lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shril chill flake foam step down
bi zigzag path jut point rock
cam shine level lake

ther drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon
brighten skirt long cloud ran forth
and sparkl keen frost hilt
for haft twinkl diamond sparks
myriad topazlight jacinthwork
of subtlest jewelleri gaze long
that eye dazzl stood
thi way divid swift mind
in act throw last seemd
bett leav excalibur conceald
ther manyknot waterflags
that whistl stiff dri marge
so strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
hast thou performd mission gave
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard rippl wash reeds
and wild water lap crag

to repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betrayd thi natur thi name
not render true answer beseemd
thi fealti like nobl knight
for surer sign followd either hand
or voic els motion mere
thi shame thing men lie
yet charg thee quick go again
a thou art lief dear thing
i bade thee watch light bring word

then went sir bediver second time
across ridg pace besid mere
count dewi pebbl fixd thought
but saw wonder hilt
how curious strang chase smote
hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sur precious thing one worthi note
should thus lost ever earth
which might pleas eye mani men
what good follow done
what harm undon deep harm disobey
se obedi bond rule
wer well obey king demand
an act unprofit himself
th king sick know does
what record relic lord
should aftertim empti breath
and rumour doubt kept
stor treasurehous mighti kings
som one might show joust arms
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nin year wrought sit deeps
upon hidden base hills
so might old man speak aftertime
to peopl win reverence
but much honour much fame lost

so spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

then spoke king arthur breath heavily
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur much wrath
ah miser unkind untrue
unknight traitorheart woe me
author forget die king
laid widowd power eye
that bowd see thee thou art
for thou latestleft knights
in meet offic all
thou wouldst betray precious hilt
eith lust gold like girl
valu giddi pleasur eyes
yet man may fail duti twice
and third time may prosper get thee hence
but thou spare fling excalibur
i aris slay thee hands

then quick rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg light plunged
among bulrush bed clutchd sword
and strong wheeld threw great brand
mad lightn splendour moon
and flash round round whirld arch
shot like streamer northern morn
seen move isl winter shock
bi night nois northern sea
so flashd fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
and caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere
and light went king

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done
speak thou hast heard seen

and answer made bold sir bedivere
sir king close mine eyelid lest gems
should blind purpos never saw
nor shall see elsewher till die
not tho live three life mortal men
so great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel him
but lookd behold arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
that caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere

and answer made king arthur breath hard
mi end draw nigh ti time gone
mak broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
mi wound hath taken cold shall die

so say pavement half rose
slowli pain reclin arm
and look wist wide blue eyes
a pictur sir bedivere
remors regard thro tears
and would spoken found words
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hands
and rise bore thro place tombs

but walkd king arthur pant hard
lik one feel nightmar bed
when hous mute sighd king
mutt murmur ear quick quick
i fear late shall die
but swift strode ridg ridge
cloth breath look walkd
larg human frozen hills
h heard deep behind cry
befor thought drove like goad
dri clashd har ici caves
and barren chasm left right
th bare black cliff clangd round based
hi foot jut slipperi crag rang
sharpsmitten dint arm heels—
and sudden lo level lake
and long glori winter moon

then saw hove duski barge
dark funer scarf stem stern
beneath descend ware
that deck dens state forms
blackstol blackhood like dream—bi these
thre queen crown gold rose
a cri shiverd tingl stars
and one voic agony
of lament like wind shrills
al night wast land one comes
or hath come sinc make world

then murmurd arthur place barge
so barg came three queens
put forth hand took king wept
but rose tallest all
and fairest laid head upon lap
and loos shatterd casqu chafe hands
and calld name complain loud
and drop bitter tear brow
strip dark blood face white
and colourless like witherd moon
smot fresh beam spring east
and greav cuiss dashd drops
of onset light lustrous curls—
that made forehead like rise sun
high daïsthrone—wer parchd dust
or clot point hang loose
mixd knight growth fring lips
so like shatterd column lay king
not like arthur lanc rest
from spur plume star tournament
shot thro list camelot charged
befor eye ladi kings

then loud cri bold sir bedivere
ah lord arthur whither shall go
wher shall hide forehead eyes
for see true old time dead
when everi morn brought nobl chance
and everi chanc brought nobl knight
such time sinc light led
th holi elder gift myrrh
but whole round tabl dissolved
which imag mighti world
and last go forth companionless
and day darken round years
among new men strang face minds

and slowli answerd arthur barge
th old order changeth yield place new
and god fulfil mani ways
lest one good custom corrupt world
comfort thyself comfort me
i live life done
may within make pure thou
if thou shouldst never see face again
pray soul thing wrought prayer
than world dream wherefor let thi voice
ris like fountain night day
for men better sheep goats
that nourish blind life within brain
if know god lift hand prayer
both call friend
for whole round earth everi way
bound gold chain foot god
but farewel go long way
with thou seëst—if inde go
for mind cloud doubt—
to islandvalley avilion
wher fall hail rain snow
nor ever wind blow loud lies
deepmeadowd happi fair orchard lawns
and boweri hollow crownd summer sea
wher heal grievous wound

so said barg oar sail
mov brink like fullbreast swan
that flute wild carol ere death
ruffl pure cold plume take flood
with swarthi web long stood sir bedivere
revolv mani memori till hull
lookd one black dot verg dawn
and mere wail die away

but moan past evermore
th still dead world winter dawn
amaz groand king gone
and therewith came weird rhyme
from great deep great deep goes

whereat slowli turnd slowli clomb
th last hard footstep iron crag
thenc markd black hull move yet cried
h pass king among dead
and heal grievous wound
h come but—if come more—
o yon dark queen yon black boat
who shriekd waild three whereat gazed
on high day cloth live light
they stood throne silenc friends
of arthur help need

then dawn seemd came faint
a beyond limit world
lik last echo born great cry
sound fair citi one voice
around king return wars

thereat move clomb
evn highest could climb saw
strain eye beneath arch hand
or thought saw speck bare king
down long water open deep

not flower flower sweet
on black coffin let strown
not friend friend greet
mi poor corps bone shall thrown
a thousand thousand sigh save

and leav blencathara rug coves
and quit flower summer brings

"aw shadow unseen power
float though unseen among u visiting
thi various world inconst wing
a summer wind creep flower flower
lik moonbeam behind pini mountain shower
it visit inconst glance
each human heart countenance
lik hue harmoni evening
lik cloud starlight wide spread
lik memori music fled
lik aught grace may be
dear yet dearer mystery

spirit beauti dost consecrate
with thine hue thou dost shine upon
of human thought form art thou gone
whi dost thou pas away leav state
thi dim vast vale tear vacant desolate
ask sunlight ever
weav rainbow oer yon mountainriver
whi aught fail fade shown
whi fear dream death birth
cast daylight earth
such gloom man scope
for love hate despond hope

no voic sublim world hath ever
to sage poet respons given
therefor name demon ghost heaven
remain record vain endeavour
frail spell whose utterd charm might avail sever
from hear see
doubt chanc mutability
thi light alon like mist oer mountain driven
or music nightwind sent
through string still instrument
or moonlight midnight stream
giv grace truth life unquiet dream

lov hope selfesteem like cloud depart
and come uncertain moment lent
man immort omnipotent
didst thou unknown aw thou art
keep thi glorious train firm state within heart
thou messeng sympathies
that wax wane lover eyes
thou human thought art nourishment
lik dark die flame
depart thi shadow came
depart not—lest grave be
lik life fear dark reality

whil yet boy sought ghost sped
through mani listen chamber cave ruin
and starlight wood fear step pursuing
hop high talk depart dead
i calld poison name youth fed
i heard saw not
when muse deepli lot
of life sweet time wind wooing
al vital thing wake bring
new bird blossoming
sudden thi shadow fell me
i shriekd claspd hand ecstasy

i vowd would dedic powers
to thee thine kept vow
with beat heart stream eye even now
i call phantom thousand hours
each voiceless grave visiond bowers
of studious zeal love delight
outwatchd envious night
they know never joy illumd brow
unlinkd hope thou wouldst free
thi world dark slavery
that thou aw loveliness
wouldst give whateer word cannot express

th day becom solemn serene
when noon past harmony
in autumn lustr sky
which summer heard seen
a could been
thus let thi power like truth
of natur passiv youth
descend onward life supply
it calm one worship thee

"mani green isl need must be

abov cold sky shone

with chill sound
from cave ice field snow

whos root besid pathway track
had bound fold o'er mani crack
which frost made between

thin eye glow'd glare
of moon die light
a fenfir beam
on sluggish stream
gleam dimly—so moon shone there
and yellow'd string thi tangl hair
that shook wind night

"roar wind night
th rain came heavili fell floods
but sun rise calm bright
th bird sing distant woods
ov sweet voic stockdov broods
th jay make answer magpi chatters
and air fill pleasant nois waters

al thing love sun doors
th sky rejoic morn birth
th grass bright raindrops—on moors
th hare run race mirth
and foot plashi earth
rais mist glitter sun
run way wherev doth run

i travel upon moor
i saw hare race joy
i heard wood distant water roar
or heard happi boy
th pleasant season heart employ
mi old remembr went wholly
and way men vain melancholy

but sometim chanceth might
of joy mind go
a high mount delight
in deject sink low
to morn happen so
and fear fanci thick upon came
dim sadness—and blind thought knew could name

i heard skylark warbl sky
and bethought play hare
even happi child earth i
even bliss creatur fare
far world walk care
but may come anoth day me—
solitud pain heart distress poverty

mi whole life live pleasant thought
a life busi summer mood
a need thing would come unsought
to genial faith still rich genial good
but expect other should
build sow call
lov take heed all

i thought chatterton marvel boy
th sleepless soul perish pride
of walk glori joy
follow plough along mountainside
bi spirit deified
w poet youth begin gladness
but thereof come end despond madness

now whether peculiar grace
a lead someth given
yet befel lone place
when untoward thought striven
besid pool bare eye heaven
i saw man unawares
th oldest man seem ever wore grey hairs

a huge stone sometim seen lie
couch bald top eminence
wond espy
bi mean could thither come whence
so seem thing endu sense
lik seabeast crawl forth shelf
of rock sand reposeth sun itself

such seem man aliv dead
nor asleep—in extrem old age
hi bodi bent doubl foot head
com togeth life pilgrimage
a dire constraint pain rage
of sick felt time long past
a human weight upon frame cast

himself prop limb bodi pale face
upon long grey staff shaven wood
and still drew near gentl pace
upon margin moorish flood
motionless cloud old man stood
that heareth loud wind call
and moveth togeth move all

at length unsettl pond
stir staff fix look
upon muddi water conned
a read book
and stranger privileg took
and draw side say
thi morn give u promis glorious day

a gentl answer old man make
in courteous speech forth slowli drew
and word thus bespake
what occup pursue
thi lonesom place one like you
er repli flash mild surprise
brok sabl orb yetvivid eyes

hi word came feebli feebl chest
but solemn order follow each
with someth lofti utter drest—
choic word measur phrase reach
of ordinari men state speech
such grave liver scotland use
religi men give god man dues

h told water come
to gather leech old poor
employ hazard wearisome
and mani hardship endure
from pond pond roam moor moor
hous god good help choic chance
and way gain honest maintenance

th old man still stood talk side
but voic like stream
scarc heard word word could divide
and whole bodi man seem
lik one met dream
or like man far region sent
to give human strength apt admonishment

mi former thought return fear kills
and hope unwil fed
cold pain labour flesh ills
and mighti poet miseri dead
—perplex long comforted
mi question eager renew
how live do

h smile word repeat
and said gather leech far wide
h travel stir thus feet
th water pool abide
onc could meet everi side
but dwindl long slow decay
yet still persever find may

whil talk thus lone place
th old man shape speech—al troubl me
in mind eye seem see pace
about weari moor continually
wand alon silently
whil thought within pursued
h made paus discours renewed

and soon matter blended
ch utter demeanour kind
but state main ended
i could laugh scorn find
