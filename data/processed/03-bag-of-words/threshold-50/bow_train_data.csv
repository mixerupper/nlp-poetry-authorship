and woodbin spice waft abroad
and musk rose blown

for breez morn moves
and planet love high
begin faint light loves

to faint light sun loves
to faint light die

al night casement jessamin stirrd
to dancer danc tune
til silenc fell wake bird
and hush set moon

i said lili one
with heart gay
when dancer leav alone
sh weari danc play

and half rise day

i said rose brief night goes
in babbl revel wine
o young lordlov sigh those

but mine mine sware rose

and soul rose went blood
a music clashd hall
and long garden lake stood
for heard rivulet fall
from lake meadow wood
our wood dearer all

from meadow walk left sweet

h set jewelprint feet
in violet blue eyes
to woodi hollow meet
and valley paradise

"day long nois battl rolld
among mountain winter sea
until king arthur tabl man man
had fallen lyonness lord
k arthur wound deep
th bold sir bediver uplift him
sir bediver last knights
and bore chapel nigh field
a broken chancel broken cross
that stood dark strait barren land
on one side lay ocean one
lay great water moon full

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
th sequel today unsold all
th goodliest fellowship famous knights
whereof world hold record sleep
they sleep—th men love think we
shal never futur time
delight soul talk knight deeds
walk garden halls
of camelot day were
i perish peopl made—
tho merlin sware come again
to rule more—but let be
i deepli smitten thro helm
that without help cannot last till morn
thou therefor take brand excalibur
which pride thou rememberest how
in old day one summer noon arm
ros bosom lake
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
hold sword—and rowd across
and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
in aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere
watch thou seëst light bring word

to repli bold sir bedivere
it meet sir king leav thee thus
aidless alon smitten thro helm
a littl thing may harm wound man
yet thi hest perform full
watch see light bring thee word

so say ruind shrine stept
and moon athwart place tombs
wher lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shril chill flake foam step down
bi zigzag path jut point rock
cam shine level lake

ther drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon
brighten skirt long cloud ran forth
and sparkl keen frost hilt
for haft twinkl diamond sparks
myriad topazlight jacinth work
of subtlest jewelleri gaze long
that eye dazzl stood
thi way divid swift mind
in act throw last seemd
bett leav excalibur conceald
ther manyknot waterflags
that whistl stiff dri marge
so strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
hast thou performd mission gave
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard rippl wash reeds
and wild water lap crag

to repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betrayd thi natur thi name
not render true answer beseemd
thi fealti like nobl knight
for surer sign followd either hand
or voic els motion mere
thi shame thing men lie
yet charg thee quick go again
a thou art lief dear thing
i bade thee watch light bring word

then went sir bediver second time
across ridg pace besid mere
count dewi pebbl fix thought
but saw wonder hilt
how curious strang chase smote
hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sur precious thing one worthi note
should thus lost forev earth
which might pleas eye mani men
what good follow done
what harm undon deep harm disobey
se obedi bond rule
wer well obey king demand
an act unprofit himself
th king sick know does
what record relic lord
should aftertim empti breath
and rumour doubt kept
stor treasurehous mighti kings
som one might show joust arms
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nin year wrought sit deeps
upon hidden base hills
so might old man speak aftertime
to peopl win reverence
but much honour much fame lost

so spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

then spoke king arthur breath heavily
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur much wrath
ah miser unkind untrue
unknight traitorheart woe me
author forget die king
laid widowd power eye
that bowd see thee thou art
for thou latestleft knights
in meet offic all
thou wouldst betray precious hilt
eith lust gold like girl
valu giddi pleasur eyes
yet man may fail duti twice
and third time may prosper get thee hence
but thou spare fling excalibur
i aris slay thee hands

then quick rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg light plunged
among bulrushb clutchd sword
and strong wheeld threw great brand
mad lightn splendour moon
and flash round round whirld arch
shot like streamer northern morn
seen move isl winter shock
bi night nois northern sea
so flashd fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
and caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere
and light went king

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done
speak thou hast heard seen

and answer made bold sir bedivere
sir king close mine eyelid lest gems
should blind purpos never saw
nor shall see elsewher till die
not tho live three life mortal men
so great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel him
but lookd behold arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
that caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere

and answer made king arthur breath hard
mi end draw nigh time gone
mak broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
mi wound hath taken cold shall die

so say pavement half rose
slowli pain reclin arm
and look wist wide blue eyes
a pictur sir bedivere
remors regard thro tears
and would spoken found words
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hands
and rise bore thro place tombs

but walkd king arthur pant hard
lik one feel nightmar bed
when hous mute sighd king
mutt murmur ear quick quick
i fear late shall die
but swift strode ridg ridge
cloth breath look walkd
larg human frozen hills
h heard deep behind cry
befor thought drove like goad
dri clashd har ici caves
and barren chasm left right
th bare black cliff clangd round based
hi foot jut slipperi crag rang
sharpsmitten dint arm heels—
and sudden lo level lake
and long glori winter moon

then saw hove duski barge
dark funer scarf stem stern
beneath descend ware
that deck dens state forms
blackstol blackhood like dream—bi these
thre queen crown gold—and rose
a cri shiverd tingl stars
and one voic agony
of lament like wind shrills
al night wast land one comes
or hath come sinc make world

then murmurd arthur place barge
and barg came three queens
put forth hand took king wept
but rose tallest all
and fairest laid head upon lap
and loos shatterd casqu chafe hands
and calld name complain loud
and drop bitter tear brow
strip dark blood face white
and colourless like witherd moon
smot fresh beam spring east
and greav cuiss dashd drops
of onset light lustrous curls—
that made forehead like rise sun
high daïsthrone—wer parchd dust
or clot point hang loose
mixd knight growth fring lips
so like shatterd column lay king
not like arthur lanc rest
from spur plume star tournament
shot thro list camelot charged
befor eye ladi kings

then loud cri bold sir bedivere
ah lord arthur whither shall go
wher shall hide forehead eyes
for see true old time dead
when everi morn brought nobl chance
and everi chanc brought nobl knight
such time sinc light led
th holi elder gift myrrh
but whole round tabl dissolved
which imag mighti world
and last go forth companionless
and day darken round years
among new men strang face minds

and slowli answerd arthur barge
th old order changeth yield place new
and god fulfil mani ways
lest one good custom corrupt world
comfort thyself comfort me
i live life done
may within make pure thou
if thou shouldst never see face again
pray soul thing wrought prayer
than world dream wherefor let thi voice
ris like fountain night day
for men better sheep goats
that nourish blind life within brain
if know god lift hand prayer
both call friend
for whole round earth everi way
bound gold chain foot god
but farewel go long way
with thou seëst—if inde go—
for mind cloud doubt
to islandvalley avilion
wher fall hail rain snow
nor ever wind blow loud lies
deepmeadowd happi fair orchardlawns
and boweri hollow crownd summer sea
wher heal grievous wound

so said barg oar sail
mov brink like fullbreast swan
that flute wild carol ere death
ruffl pure cold plume take flood
with swarthi web long stood sir bedivere

her beach wanderd nourish youth sublime
with fairi tale scienc long result time

when centuri behind like fruit land reposed

in spring young man fanci light turn thought love

then cheek pale thinner one young

and said cousin ami speak speak truth me

on pallid cheek forehead came colour light
a seen rosi red flush northern night

"monodrama
o twere possible
aft long grief pain
to find arm true love

when wont meet her
in silent woodi places
bi home gave birth

mixt kiss sweeter sweeter
than anyth earth

a shadow flit me
not thou like thee
ah christ possible
for one short hour see
th soul love might tell us
what be

it lead forth evening
it light wind steals
in cold white robe me
when spirit reels
at shout leagu lights
and roar wheels

half night wast sighs
half dream sorrow after
th delight earli skies
in wake doze sorrow
for hand lip eyes
for meet morrow
th delight happi laughter
th delight low replies

ti morn pure sweet
and dewi splendour falls
on littl flower clings
to turret walls
ti morn pure sweet
and light shadow fleet
sh walk meadow
and woodland echo rings
in moment shall meet
sh sing meadow
and rivulet feet
rippl light shadow
to ballad sings

so hear sing old
mi bird shine head
mi dove tender eye
but ring sudden passion cry
ther one die dead
and sullen thunder rolld
for tumult shake city
and wake dream fled
in shudder dawn behold
without knowledg without pity
bi curtain bed

that heard soft call
cam glimmer thro laurels
at quiet evenfall
in garden turrets
of old manori hall

would happi spirit descend
from realm light song
in chamber street
a look among blest
should fear greet friend
or say forgiv wrong
or ask take sweet

but broad light glare beats
and shadow flit fleets
and let be
and loath squar streets
and face one meets

"stori bold sir bedivere
first made latest left knights
told man voice
in white winter age those
with dwelt new face minds

for march westward bedivere
who slowli pace among slumber host
heard tent moan king

and care thou dream rise—
i hear step modr west
and mani thi peopl knights
onc thine thou hast love grosser grown
than heathen spit vow thee

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
far battl west
whereto move strove youth
and brake petti king fought rome
or thrust heathen roman wall
and shook thro north ill doom mine
to war peopl knights
th king fight peopl fight himself
and knight love stroke
that strike dead death me
yet let u henc find feel way
thro blind haze ever sinc saw
on lie dust almesbury

then rose king move host night
and ever pushd sir modr leagu league
back sunset bound lyonnesse—
a land old upheaven abyss
bi fire sink abyss again
wher fragment forgotten peopl dwelt
and long mountain end coast

and fled fli king
and day great light heaven
burnd lowest roll year
on wast sand wast sea closed
nor ever yet arthur fought fight
lik last dim weird battl west
a deathwhit mist slept sand sea
whereof chill breath drew
down blood till heart cold
with formless fear evn arthur fell
confus sinc saw fought

for friend foe shadow mist
and friend slew friend know slew
and vision golden youth
and beheld face old ghosts
look upon battl mist
wa mani nobl deed mani base
and chanc craft strength singl fights
and ever anon host host

of battleax shatterd helm shrieks
aft christ fall down
lookd heaven saw mist
and shout heathen traitor knights
oath insult filth monstrous blasphemies
sweat writh anguish labour lungs
in close mist cri light
moan die voic dead

last one deathb wail
of suffer silenc follow thro death
or deathlik swoon thus shore
sav whisper seeth seas
a dead hush fell dolor day
grew drearier toward twilight fall came

nor yet heathen wan wave
brak among dead face fro
sway helpless hand down
tumbl hollow helmet fallen
and shiverd brand fought rome
and roll far along gloomi shores

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
and whiter mist day long
had held field battl king

hearest thou great voic shake world
and wast narrow realm whereon move
and beat upon face dead
mi dead tho die me—
o bediver heart hath falln

then spake bold sir bediver king
k everywher dead kings
ther also worship thee king
yet still thi life whole still live
who love thee hate thee brought
th heathen back among u yonder stands
modr unharmd traitor thine house

then spake king hous hath doom
but call thou traitor house
who hath dwelt beneath one roof me
mi hous rather sware vows
yea even brake ownd king
and well thee say dark hour
when purport throne hath faild
that quick dead thou hottest king
k whatsoev cry
and one last act kinghood shalt thou see
yet ere pas utter king
mad man modr smote liege

so day long nois battl rolld
among mountain winter sea
until king arthur tabl man man
had falln lyonness lord
k arthur wound deep
th bold sir bediver uplift him
and bore chapel nigh field
a broken chancel broken cross
that stood dark strait barren land
on one side lay ocean one
lay great water moon full

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
th sequel today unsold all
th goodliest fellowship famous knights
whereof world hold record sleep
they sleep—th men love think we
shal never futur time
delight soul talk knight deeds
walk garden halls
of camelot day were
i perish peopl made—
tho merlin sware come again
to rule let be
i deepli smitten thro helm
that without help cannot last till morn
thou therefor take brand excalibur
which pride thou rememberest how
in old day one summer noon arm
ros bosom lake
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
hold sword—and rowd across
and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
in aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere
watch thou seëst light bring word

to repli bold sir bedivere
it meet sir king leav thee thus
aidless alon smitten thro helm—
a littl thing may harm wound man
yet thi hest perform full
watch see light bring thee word

so say ruind shrine stept
and moon athwart place tombs
wher lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shril chill flake foam step down
bi zigzag path jut point rock
cam shine level lake

ther drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon
brighten skirt long cloud ran forth
and sparkl keen frost hilt
for haft twinkl diamond sparks
myriad topazlight jacinthwork
of subtlest jewelleri gaze long
that eye dazzl stood
thi way divid swift mind
in act throw last seemd
bett leav excalibur conceald
ther manyknot waterflags
that whistl stiff dri marge
so strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bedivere
hast thou performd mission gave
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard rippl wash reeds
and wild water lap crag

to repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betrayd thi natur thi name
not render true answer beseemd
thi fealti like nobl knight
for surer sign followd either hand
or voic els motion mere
thi shame thing men lie
yet charg thee quick go again
a thou art lief dear thing
i bade thee watch light bring word

then went sir bediver second time
across ridg pace besid mere
count dewi pebbl fixd thought
but saw wonder hilt
how curious strang chase smote
hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sur precious thing one worthi note
should thus lost ever earth
which might pleas eye mani men
what good follow done
what harm undon deep harm disobey
se obedi bond rule
wer well obey king demand
an act unprofit himself
th king sick know does
what record relic lord
should aftertim empti breath
and rumour doubt kept
stor treasurehous mighti kings
som one might show joust arms
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nin year wrought sit deeps
upon hidden base hills
so might old man speak aftertime
to peopl win reverence
but much honour much fame lost

so spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

then spoke king arthur breath heavily
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bedivere
i heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reeds

to repli king arthur much wrath
ah miser unkind untrue
unknight traitorheart woe me
author forget die king
laid widowd power eye
that bowd see thee thou art
for thou latestleft knights
in meet offic all
thou wouldst betray precious hilt
eith lust gold like girl
valu giddi pleasur eyes
yet man may fail duti twice
and third time may prosper get thee hence
but thou spare fling excalibur
i aris slay thee hands

then quick rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg light plunged
among bulrush bed clutchd sword
and strong wheeld threw great brand
mad lightn splendour moon
and flash round round whirld arch
shot like streamer northern morn
seen move isl winter shock
bi night nois northern sea
so flashd fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
and caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere
and light went king

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done
speak thou hast heard seen

and answer made bold sir bedivere
sir king close mine eyelid lest gems
should blind purpos never saw
nor shall see elsewher till die
not tho live three life mortal men
so great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel him
but lookd behold arm
cloth white samit mystic wonderful
that caught hilt brandishd him
thre time drew mere

and answer made king arthur breath hard
mi end draw nigh ti time gone
mak broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
mi wound hath taken cold shall die

so say pavement half rose
slowli pain reclin arm
and look wist wide blue eyes
a pictur sir bedivere
remors regard thro tears
and would spoken found words
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hands
and rise bore thro place tombs

but walkd king arthur pant hard
lik one feel nightmar bed
when hous mute sighd king
mutt murmur ear quick quick
i fear late shall die
but swift strode ridg ridge
cloth breath look walkd
larg human frozen hills
h heard deep behind cry
befor thought drove like goad
dri clashd har ici caves
and barren chasm left right
th bare black cliff clangd round based
hi foot jut slipperi crag rang
sharpsmitten dint arm heels—
and sudden lo level lake
and long glori winter moon

then saw hove duski barge
dark funer scarf stem stern
beneath descend ware
that deck dens state forms
blackstol blackhood like dream—bi these
thre queen crown gold rose
a cri shiverd tingl stars
and one voic agony
of lament like wind shrills
al night wast land one comes
or hath come sinc make world

then murmurd arthur place barge
so barg came three queens
put forth hand took king wept
but rose tallest all
and fairest laid head upon lap
and loos shatterd casqu chafe hands
and calld name complain loud
and drop bitter tear brow
strip dark blood face white
and colourless like witherd moon
smot fresh beam spring east
and greav cuiss dashd drops
of onset light lustrous curls—
that made forehead like rise sun
high daïsthrone—wer parchd dust
or clot point hang loose
mixd knight growth fring lips
so like shatterd column lay king
not like arthur lanc rest
from spur plume star tournament
shot thro list camelot charged
befor eye ladi kings

then loud cri bold sir bedivere
ah lord arthur whither shall go
wher shall hide forehead eyes
for see true old time dead
when everi morn brought nobl chance
and everi chanc brought nobl knight
such time sinc light led
th holi elder gift myrrh
but whole round tabl dissolved
which imag mighti world
and last go forth companionless
and day darken round years
among new men strang face minds

and slowli answerd arthur barge
th old order changeth yield place new
and god fulfil mani ways
lest one good custom corrupt world
comfort thyself comfort me
i live life done
may within make pure thou
if thou shouldst never see face again
pray soul thing wrought prayer
than world dream wherefor let thi voice
ris like fountain night day
for men better sheep goats
that nourish blind life within brain
if know god lift hand prayer
both call friend
for whole round earth everi way
bound gold chain foot god
but farewel go long way
with thou seëst—if inde go
for mind cloud doubt—
to islandvalley avilion
wher fall hail rain snow
nor ever wind blow loud lies
deepmeadowd happi fair orchard lawns
and boweri hollow crownd summer sea
wher heal grievous wound

so said barg oar sail
mov brink like fullbreast swan
that flute wild carol ere death
ruffl pure cold plume take flood
with swarthi web long stood sir bedivere
revolv mani memori till hull
lookd one black dot verg dawn
and mere wail die away

but moan past evermore
th still dead world winter dawn
amaz groand king gone
and therewith came weird rhyme
from great deep great deep goes

whereat slowli turnd slowli clomb
th last hard footstep iron crag
thenc markd black hull move yet cried
h pass king among dead
and heal grievous wound
h come but—if come more—
o yon dark queen yon black boat
who shriekd waild three whereat gazed
on high day cloth live light
they stood throne silenc friends
of arthur help need

then dawn seemd came faint
a beyond limit world
lik last echo born great cry
sound fair citi one voice
around king return wars

thereat move clomb
evn highest could climb saw
strain eye beneath arch hand
or thought saw speck bare king

"roar wind night
th rain came heavili fell floods
but sun rise calm bright
th bird sing distant woods
ov sweet voic stockdov broods
th jay make answer magpi chatters
and air fill pleasant nois waters

al thing love sun doors
th sky rejoic morn birth
th grass bright raindrops—on moors
th hare run race mirth
and foot plashi earth
rais mist glitter sun
run way wherev doth run

i travel upon moor
i saw hare race joy
i heard wood distant water roar
or heard happi boy
th pleasant season heart employ
mi old remembr went wholly
and way men vain melancholy

but sometim chanceth might
of joy mind go
a high mount delight
in deject sink low
to morn happen so
and fear fanci thick upon came
dim sadness—and blind thought knew could name

i heard skylark warbl sky
and bethought play hare
even happi child earth i
even bliss creatur fare
far world walk care
but may come anoth day me—
solitud pain heart distress poverty

mi whole life live pleasant thought
a life busi summer mood
a need thing would come unsought
to genial faith still rich genial good
but expect other should
build sow call
lov take heed all

i thought chatterton marvel boy
th sleepless soul perish pride
of walk glori joy
follow plough along mountainside
bi spirit deified
w poet youth begin gladness
but thereof come end despond madness

now whether peculiar grace
a lead someth given
yet befel lone place
when untoward thought striven
besid pool bare eye heaven
i saw man unawares
th oldest man seem ever wore grey hairs

a huge stone sometim seen lie
couch bald top eminence
wond espy
bi mean could thither come whence
so seem thing endu sense
lik seabeast crawl forth shelf
of rock sand reposeth sun itself

such seem man aliv dead
nor asleep—in extrem old age
hi bodi bent doubl foot head
com togeth life pilgrimage
a dire constraint pain rage
of sick felt time long past
a human weight upon frame cast

himself prop limb bodi pale face
upon long grey staff shaven wood
and still drew near gentl pace
upon margin moorish flood
motionless cloud old man stood
that heareth loud wind call
and moveth togeth move all

at length unsettl pond
stir staff fix look
upon muddi water conned
a read book
and stranger privileg took
and draw side say
thi morn give u promis glorious day

a gentl answer old man make
in courteous speech forth slowli drew
and word thus bespake
what occup pursue
thi lonesom place one like you
er repli flash mild surprise
brok sabl orb yetvivid eyes

hi word came feebli feebl chest
but solemn order follow each
with someth lofti utter drest—
choic word measur phrase reach
of ordinari men state speech
such grave liver scotland use
religi men give god man dues

h told water come
to gather leech old poor
employ hazard wearisome
and mani hardship endure
from pond pond roam moor moor
hous god good help choic chance
and way gain honest maintenance

th old man still stood talk side
but voic like stream
scarc heard word word could divide
and whole bodi man seem
lik one met dream
or like man far region sent
to give human strength apt admonishment

mi former thought return fear kills
and hope unwil fed
cold pain labour flesh ills
and mighti poet miseri dead
—perplex long comforted
mi question eager renew
how live do

h smile word repeat
and said gather leech far wide
h travel stir thus feet
th water pool abide
onc could meet everi side
but dwindl long slow decay
yet still persever find may

whil talk thus lone place
th old man shape speech—al troubl me
in mind eye seem see pace
about weari moor continually
wand alon silently
whil thought within pursued
h made paus discours renewed

and soon matter blended
ch utter demeanour kind
but state main ended
i could laugh scorn find
