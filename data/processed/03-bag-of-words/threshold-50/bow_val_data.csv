"this—yarrow—thi stream
of fanci cherished
so faith wake dream

o minstrel harp near
to utter note gladness
and chase silenc air

yet why—a silveri current flows
with uncontrol meanderings
nor eye greener hills
been sooth wanderings
and depth saint mari lake
i visibl delighted
for featur hills

th grace forest charm decayed
and pastor melancholy

that region left vale unfolds

with yarrow wind pomp
of cultiv nature
and rise lofti groves

for sportiv youth stray in
for manhood enjoy strength
and age wear away in
yon cottag seem bower bliss
a covert protection
of tender thought nestl there—
th brood chast affection

how sweet autumn day

and truelov forehead plant
a crest bloom heather
and enwreath own
twer offenc reason

to meet wintri season

and gladsom note lip breathe
